\chapter*{Foreword}  
% This thesis provided me with the opportunity to apply the theory and methods I acquired throughout the entire master's programme to the study of enzymatic processes, aligning perfectly with my interest in biological systems. The research was conducted in collaboration with the research group led by Prof. Iñaki Tuñón at the University of Valencia, well known for their expertise in modelling enzymatic reactions.

% \noindent I would like to express my gratitude to both Prof. Jeremy Harvey and Prof. Iñaki Tuñón for giving me the opportunity to independently explore my ideas as well as providing invaluable assistance and guidance whenever needed. Their kind and friendly attitude ensured that this whole project was a very enjoyable experience for me.

% \noindent Thanks to all members of the ``Modeling Chemical Processes in Biological Environments'' research group, as well as to TCCM students in Valencia, for their openness and friendliness which made my stay in Valencia feel like home. In addition, I am grateful to my fellow TCCM students from Leuven for the wonderful experiences we shared, from engaging in scientific discussions to participating in fun activities.

% \noindent I also want to thank Milorad Anđelković for providing me with example input files for running molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, I am thankful to the University of Valencia for the computational resources used for all calculations and the TCCM programme, supported by the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union, for the scholarship which made my enrollment possible.

\chapter*{Contribution statement}
Albert Makhmudov proposed revisiting phosphate hydrolysis using a more advanced computational setup. Prof. Jeremy Harvey suggested the investigation of a system containing methyl diphosphate and proposed the use of a neural network potential to describe the reaction mechanism. The overall workflow was designed together by Albert Makhmudov and Prof. Jeremy Harvey, who also jointly analysed the results. All calculations, figures, and visualisations were carried out by Albert Makhmudov. The thesis was written by Albert Makhmudov with feedback and corrections from Prof. Jeremy Harvey.
