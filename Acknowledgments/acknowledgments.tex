\chapter*{Foreword}  
% This thesis provided me with the opportunity to apply the theory and methods I acquired throughout the entire master's programme to the study of enzymatic processes, aligning perfectly with my interest in biological systems. The research was conducted in collaboration with the research group led by Prof. Iñaki Tuñón at the University of Valencia, well known for their expertise in modelling enzymatic reactions.

% \noindent I would like to express my gratitude to both Prof. Jeremy Harvey and Prof. Iñaki Tuñón for giving me the opportunity to independently explore my ideas as well as providing invaluable assistance and guidance whenever needed. Their kind and friendly attitude ensured that this whole project was a very enjoyable experience for me.

% \noindent Thanks to all members of the ``Modeling Chemical Processes in Biological Environments'' research group, as well as to TCCM students in Valencia, for their openness and friendliness which made my stay in Valencia feel like home. In addition, I am grateful to my fellow TCCM students from Leuven for the wonderful experiences we shared, from engaging in scientific discussions to participating in fun activities.

% \noindent I also want to thank Milorad Anđelković for providing me with example input files for running molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, I am thankful to the University of Valencia for the computational resources used for all calculations and the TCCM programme, supported by the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union, for the scholarship which made my enrollment possible.

\chapter*{Contribution statement}
% Prof. Jeremy Harvey made the initial suggestion of studying stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) using a QM/MM approach, combining an efficient semiempirical method and higher level of theory corrections, inspired by a publication from my co-supervisor, Prof. Iñaki Tuñón. I made the link of SCD1 to transmembrane non-heme diiron enzymes and had the idea to propose a new reactive species. I also prepared the system and performed all calculations and analysis. Of course, my supervisors helped me along the way with experimental design, evaluation of results and other insights. The thesis is written by me with minor corrections from my supervisors.
