\chapter{Introduction}
% The goal of this chapter is to give an overview of the available knowledge about stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) which is the main focus of this thesis. SCD1 is an iron-containing enzyme and member of the large non-heme iron enzyme family. The chapter starts  explaining the role of iron in biological systems and moves on to discuss the experimental and theoretical methods used to study non-heme iron enzymes. An overview of the rich chemistry of both binuclear and mononuclear non-heme iron enzymes is given before discussing the reactivity and importance of SCD1.
