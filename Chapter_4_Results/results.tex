    \caption{Accuracy of the neural network potential trained on 12,000 data points. The left panel shows the errors in the forces and energy for the tensor rank $\ell=1$ and the right panel shows the errors for $\ell=2$. The errors are calculated as the difference between the neural network potential and the reference DFT values. For the histograms, the number of bins was set to 50.}
