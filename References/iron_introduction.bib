A spectroscopic methodology was developed that provides significant mechanistic insight into the reactivity of non-heme ferrous active sites. These studies reveal a general mechanistic strategy used by these enzymes and differences in substrate and cofactor interactions dependent on their requirement for activation by iron. Contributions to O2 activation have been elucidated for non-heme relative to heme ligand sets, and major differences in reactivity are defined with respect to the heterolytic and homolytic cleavage of O-O bonds.},

This Current Topics article summarizes both the molecular mechanism these enzymes use to control O2 activation in the presence of cosubstrates and the oxygen intermediates these reactions generate. Three types of O2 activation are observed. First, non-heme reactivity is shown to be different from heme chemistry where a low-spin FeIII-OOH non-heme intermediate directly reacts with substrate. Also, two subclasses of non-heme Fe enzymes generate high-spin FeIV=O intermediates that provide both σ and π frontier molecular orbitals that can control selectivity. Finally, for several subclasses of non-heme Fe enzymes, binding of the substrate to the FeII site leads to the one-electron reductive activation of O2 to an FeIII-superoxide capable of H atom abstraction and electrophilic attack.},

We emphasize that the concerted progress on both theoretical and experimental side is a conditio sine qua non for future understanding, exploration and utilization of the NHFe(2) systems. After briefly discussing the current challenges and advances in the computational methodology, we review the recent spectroscopic and computational studies of NHFe(2) enzymatic and inorganic systems and highlight the correlations between various experimental data (spectroscopic, kinetic, thermodynamic, electrochemical) and computations. Throughout, we attempt to keep in mind the most fascinating and attractive phenomenon in the NHFe(2) chemistry, which is the fact that despite the strong oxidative power of many reactive intermediates, the NHFe(2) enzymes perform catalysis with high selectivity. We conclude with our personal viewpoint and hope that further developments in quantum chemistry and especially in the field of multireference wave function methods are needed to have a solid theoretical basis for the NHFe(2) studies, mostly by providing benchmarking and calibration of the computationally efficient and easy-to-use DFT methods.},

In this review, we survey the various enzymes belonging to this unique subset and the mechanisms by which substrate oxidation is carried out. We examine the nature of the reactive intermediates, as revealed by X-ray crystallography and the application of various spectroscopic methods and their associated reactivity. We also discuss the structural and electronic properties of the model complexes that have been found to mimic salient aspects of these enzyme active sites.

Mechanistic details of demethylation are yet to be elucidated and are important for the understanding of epigenetic processes. We have evaluated the initial step of histone demethylation by JMJD2A and demonstrate the dramatic effect of the protein environment upon oxygen binding using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. The changes in electronic structure have been studied for possible spin states and different conformations of O2, using a combination of quantum and classical simulations. O2 binding to this histone demethylase is computed to occur preferentially as an end-on superoxo radical bound to a high-spin ferric centre, yielding an overall quintet ground state. The favourability of binding is strongly influenced by the surrounding protein: we have quantified this effect using an energy decomposition scheme into electrostatic and dispersion contributions. His182 and the methylated lysine assist while Glu184 and the oxoglutarate cofactor are deleterious for O2 binding. Charge separation in the superoxo-intermediate benefits from the electrostatic stabilization provided by the surrounding residues, stabilizing the binding process significantly. This work demonstrates the importance of the extended protein environment in oxygen binding, and the role of energy decomposition in understanding the physical origin of binding/recognition.},

The experimental research suggests that water molecules play an important role in the catalytic reaction process of HEPD. This work proposes a water involved reaction mechanism where water molecules serve as an oxygen source in the generation of mononuclear nonheme iron oxo complexes. These molecules can take part in the catalytic cycle before the carbon-carbon bond cleavage process. The properties of trapped water molecules are also discussed. Meanwhile, water molecules seem to be responsible for converting the reactive hydroxyl radical group (-OH) to the ferric hydroxide (Fe(III)-OH) in a specific way. This converting reaction may prevent the enzyme from damages caused by the hydroxyl radical groups. So, water molecules may serve as biological catalysts just like the work in the heme enzyme P450 StaP. This work could provide a better interpretation on how the intermediates interact with water molecules and a further understanding on the O18 label experimental evidence in which only a relatively smaller ratio of oxygen atoms in water molecules (∼40) are incorporated into the final product HMP. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {The protein environment can have significant effects on the enzyme catalysis even though the reaction occurs locally at the reaction center. In this paper, we describe an efficient scheme that includes a classical molecular dynamics (MD) free-energy perturbation (FEP) correction to the reaction energy diagram, as a complement to the protein effect obtained from static ONIOM (QM:MM) calculations. The method is applied to eight different reaction steps, from the O2-bound reactant to formation of a high-valent ferryl-oxo intermediate, in the nonheme iron enzyme isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS), for which the QM:MM energy diagram has previously been computed [Lundberg, M. et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2009, 5, 220 -234]. This large span of the reaction coordinate is covered by dividing each reaction step into microsteps using a virtual reaction coordinate, thus only requiring ONIOM information about the stationary points themselves. Protein effects are important for C-H bond activation and heterolytic O-O bond cleavage because both these two steps involve charge transfer, and compared to a static QM:MM energies, the dynamics of the protein environment changes the barrier for O-O bond cleavage by several kcal/mol. The origin of the dynamical contribution is analyzed in two terms, the geometrical effect caused by the change in average protein geometry (compared to the optimized geometry) in the room temperature MD simulation with the solvent, and the statistical (entropic) effect resulting from fluctuations in the interactions between the active site and the protein environment. These two effects give significant contributions in different steps of the reaction. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), the rate-limiting enzyme in monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis, has recently been shown to be the critical control point regulating hepatic lipogenesis and lipid oxidation. As several manifestations of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus are associated with alterations in intracellular lipid partitioning, we propose that SCD1 may be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. In support of this notion, we have shown that SCD1-deficient mice have increased energy expenditure, reduced body adiposity, increased insulin sensitivity and are resistant to diet-induced obesity and liver steatosis. Furthermore, SCD1 was found to be specifically repressed during leptin-mediated weight loss, and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice lacking SCD1 showed marked correction of the hypometabolic phenotype and hepatic steatosis. Much evidence indicates that the direct anti-steatotic effect of SCD1 deficiency stems from increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased lipid synthesis. All of these findings reveal that pharmacological manipulation of SCD activity might be of benefit in the treatment of obesity, diabetes, liver steatosis and other diseases of the metabolic syndrome. © 2005 The International Association for the Study of Obesity.},

These molecules, in addition to being structural components of newly formed cell membranes of intensely proliferating cancer cells, support tumorigenic signaling. An increase in the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), the enzyme that converts saturated fatty acids to D9-monounsaturated fatty acids, has been observed in a wide range of cancer cells, and this increase is correlated with cancer aggressiveness and poor outcomes for patients. Studies have demonstrated the involvement of SCD1 in the promotion of cancer cell proliferation, migration, metastasis, and tumor growth. Many studies have reported a role for this lipogenic factor in maintaining the characteristics of cancer stem cells (i.e., the population of cells that contributes to cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy). Importantly, both the products of SCD1 activity and its direct impact on tumorigenic pathways have been demonstrated. Based on these findings, SCD1 appears to be a significant player in the development of malignant disease and may be a promising target for anticancer therapy. Numerous chemical compounds that exert inhibitory effects on SCD1 have been developed and preclinically tested. The present review summarizes our current knowledge of the ways in which SCD1 contributes to the progression of cancer and discusses opportunities and challenges of using SCD1 inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.},

Our understanding of the chemistry of these key intermediates has improved greatly by studies of the structural and spectroscopic properties and reactivities of their synthetic analogues. One class of biomimetic coordination complexes that has proven to be particularly versatile in studying dioxygen activation by metal complexes is comprised of Fe IVO and Fe IIIO 2(H) complexes of the macrocyclic tetramethylcyclam ligand (TMC, 1,4,8,11-tetramethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane). Several recent advances have been made in the synthesis and isolation of new iron-oxygen complexes of this ligand, their structural and spectroscopic characterization, and elucidation of their reactivities in various oxidation reactions. In this review, we summarize the chemistry of the first structurally characterized mononuclear nonheme iron(IV)-oxo complex, in which the Fe IVO group was stabilized by the TMC ligand. Complexes with different axial ligands, [Fe IV(O)(TMC)(X)] n+, and complexes of other cyclam ligands are discussed as well. Very recently, significant progress has also been reported in the area of other iron-oxygen intermediates, such as iron(III)-superoxo, iron(III)-peroxo, and iron(III)-hydroperoxo complexes bearing the TMC ligand.

   abstract = {Oxo-iron(IV) species are implicated as key intermediates in the catalytic cycles of heme and nonheme oxygen activating iron enzymes that selectively functionalize aliphatic C-H bonds. Ferryl complexes can exist in either quintet or triplet ground states. Density functional theory calculations predict that the quintet oxo-iron(IV) species is more reactive toward C-H bond activation than its corresponding triplet partner, however; the available experimental data on model complexes suggests that both spin multiplicities display comparable reactivities. To clarify this ambiguity, a detailed electronic structure analysis of alkane hydroxylation by an oxo-iron(IV) species on different spin-state potential energy surfaces is performed. According to our results, the lengthening of the Fe-oxo bond in ferryl reactants, which is the part of the reaction coordinate for H-atom abstraction, leads to the formation of oxyl-iron(III) species that then perform actual C-H bond activation. The differential reactivity stems from the fact that the two spin states have different requirements for the optimal angle at which the substrate should approach the (FeO)2+ core because distinct electron acceptor orbitals are employed on the two surfaces. The H-atom abstraction on the quintet surface favors the "σ-pathway" that requires an essentially linear attack; by contrast a "π-channel" is operative on the triplet surface that leads to an ideal attack angle near 90°. However, the latter is not possible due to steric crowding; thus, the attenuated orbital interaction and the unavoidably increased Pauli repulsion result in the lower reactivity of the triplet oxo-iron(IV) complexes.},

   abstract = {High-valent FeIV=O species are key intermediates in the catalytic cycles of many mononuclear non-heme iron enzymes and have been structurally defined in model systems. Variable-temperature magnetic circular dichroism (VT-MCD) spectroscopy has been used to evaluate the electronic structures and in particular the Fe-O bonds of three FeIV=O (S = 1) model complexes, [FeIV(O)(TMC)(NCMe)]2+, [Fe IV(O)(TMC)(OC(O)CF3)]+, and [Fe IV(O)(N4Py)]2+. These complexes are characterized by their strong and covalent Fe-O π-bonds. The MCD spectra show a vibronic progression in the nonbonding → π* excited state, providing the Fe-O stretching frequency and the Fe-O bond length in this excited state and quantifying the π-contribution to the total Fe-O bond. Correlation of these experimental data to reactivity shows that the [FeIV(O)(N4Py)] 2+ complex, with the highest reactivity toward hydrogen-atom abstraction among the three, has the strongest Fe-O π-bond. Density functional calculations were correlated to the data and support the experimental analysis. The strength and covalency of the Fe-O π-bond result in high oxygen character in the important frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) for this reaction, the unoccupied β-spin d(xz/yz) orbitals, that activates these for electrophilic attack. An extension to biologically relevant FeIV=O (S = 2) enzyme intermediates shows that these can perform electrophilic attack reactions along the same mechanistic pathway (π-FMO pathway) with similar reactivity but also have an additional reaction channel involving the unoccupied α-spin d(z2) orbital (σ-FMO pathway). These studies experimentally probe the FMOs involved in the reactivity of FeIV=O (S = 1) model complexes resulting in a detailed understanding of the Fe-O bond and its contributions to reactivity. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

Recently, less-characterized ferric-superoxo species have been found or suggested to be another electrophilic oxidant. Reactivity of several vital ferryl-oxo and ferric-superoxo model complexes was examined by DFT calculations. Reactivity is found to correlate well with thermodynamic driving force and can increase with higher electrophilicity of the oxidant. Reactivity of the ferric-superoxo oxidants generally is not "superior" to the ferryl-oxo ones. Compared to the high-spin non-heme ferric-superoxo, the lower reactivity of low-spin heme ferric-superoxo, seldom utilized in nature, can be attributed to lower electrophilicity and more pronounced quenching of anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the ferric and superoxo parts. The present comparison should shed some light on mechanistic strategies in heme and non-heme enzymes and provide clues to rational design of ferric-superoxo oxidants. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) is a unique mononuclear nonheme Fe enzyme that catalyzes the four-electron oxidative double ring closure of its substrate ACV. A combination of spectroscopic techniques including EPR, absorbance, circular dichroism (CD), magnetic CD, and variable-temperature, variable-field MCD (VTVH-MCD) were used to evaluate the geometric and electronic structure of the \{FeNO\}7 complex of IPNS coordinated with the ACV thiolate ligand. Density Function Theory (DFT) calculations correlated to the spectroscopic data were used to generate an experimentally calibrated bonding description of the Fe-IPNS-ACV-NO complex. New spectroscopic features introduced by the binding of the ACV thiolate at 13 100 and 19 800 cm-1 are assigned as the NO π*(ip) → Fe dx2-y2 and S π→ Fe d x2-y2 charge transfer (CT) transitions, respectively. Configuration interaction mixes S CT character into the NO π(ip) → Fe d x2-y2 CT transition, which is observed experimentally from the VTVH-MCD data from this transition. Calculations on the hypothetical \{FeO 2\}8 complex of Fe-IPNS-ACV reveal that the configuration interaction present in the \{FeNO\}7 complex results in an unoccupied frontier molecular orbital (FMO) with correct orientation and distal O character for H-atom abstraction from the ACV substrate. The energetics of NO/O 2 binding to Fe-IPNS-ACV were evaluated and demonstrate that charge donation from the ACV thiolate ligand renders the formation of the Fe III-superoxide complex energetically favorable, driving the reaction at the Fe center. This single center reaction allows IPNS to avoid the O 2 bridged binding generally invoked in other nonheme Fe enzymes that leads to oxygen insertion (i.e., oxygenase function) and determines the oxidase activity of IPNS. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Bleomycin (BLM) is a glycopeptide anticancer drug that effectively carries out single- and double-stranded DNA cleavage. Activated BLM (ABLM), a low-spin ferric-hydroperoxide, BLM-FeIII-OOH, is the last intermediate detected before DNA cleavage. We have previously shown through experiments and DFT calculations that both ABLM decay and reaction with H atom donors proceed via direct H atom abstraction. However, the rate of ABLM decay had been previously found, based on indirect methods, to be independent of the presence of DNA. In this study, we use a circular dichroism (CD) feature unique to ABLM to directly monitor the kinetics of ABLM reaction with a DNA oligonucleotide. Our results show that the ABLM + DNA reaction is appreciably faster, has a different kinetic isotope effect, and has a lower Arrhenius activation energy than does ABLM decay. In the ABLM reaction with DNA, the small normal kH/kD ratio is attributed to a secondary solvent effect through DFT vibrational analysis of reactant and transition state (TS) frequencies, and the lower E a is attributed to the weaker bond involved in the abstraction reaction (C-H for DNA and N-H for the decay in the absence of DNA). The DNA dependence of the ABLM reaction indicates that DNA is involved in the TS for ABLM decay and thus reacts directly with BLM-FeIII-OOH instead of its decay product. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

The homolysis reaction of the HS [(TMC)FeIII-OOH]2+ complex is found to involve axial ligand coordination and a crossing to the LS surface for O-O bond homolysis. Both HS and LS FeIII-OOH complexes are found to perform direct H-atom abstraction reactions but with very different reaction coordinates. For the LS FeIII-OOH, the transition state is late in O-O and early in C-H coordinates. However, for the HS FeIII-OOH, the transition state is early in O-O and further along in the C-H coordinate. In addition, there is a significant amount of electron transfer from the substrate to the HS FeIII-OOH at transition state, but that does not occur in the LS transition state. Thus, in contrast to the behavior of LS FeIII-OOH, the H-atom abstraction reactivity of HS FeIII-OOH is found to be highly dependent on both the ionization potential and the C-H bond strength of the substrate. LS FeIII-OOH is found to be more effective in H-atom abstraction for strong C-H bonds, while the higher reduction potential of HS FeIII-OOH allows it to be active in electrophilic reactions without the requirement of O-O bond cleavage. This is relevant to the Rieske dioxygenases, which are proposed to use a HS FeIII-OOH to catalyze cis-dihydroxylation of a wide range of aromatic compounds. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Here we report the 3.25-Å crystal structure of human SCD1 in complex with its substrate, stearoyl–coenzyme A, which defines the new SCD1 dimetal catalytic center and reveals the determinants of substrate binding to provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of desaturation of the stearoyl moiety. The structure also provides a mechanism for localization of SCD1 in the endoplasmic reticulum: human SCD1 folds around a tight hydrophobic core formed from four long α-helices that presumably function as an anchor spanning the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.

The enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) catalyses the addition of the first double bond into saturated fatty acyl-CoAs, leading to monounsaturated products, which among other roles are essential for fatty acid metabolism. SCD is seen as a drug target for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases, not least because mice deficient in one such enzyme (SCD1) have improved lipid metabolic profiles and insulin sensitivity and so do not become obese or diabetic when fed a high-fat diet. Here Ming Zhou and colleagues report the crystal structure of mouse SCD1 bound to the fatty acid stearoyl-CoA at 2.6 Å resolution. The structure reveals a possible pathway for lateral substrate access and product exit, and the acyl chain of the bound fatty acid is shown to be shielded and shaped to a particular conformation by the enzyme, providing a structural basis for the selectivity of fatty acid metabolism. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is conserved in all eukaryotes and introduces the first double bond into saturated fatty acyl-CoAs1,2,3,4. Because the monounsaturated products of SCD are key precursors of membrane phospholipids, cholesterol esters and triglycerides, SCD is pivotal in fatty acid metabolism. Humans have two SCD homologues (SCD1 and SCD5), while mice have four (SCD1–SCD4). SCD1-deficient mice do not become obese or diabetic when fed a high-fat diet because of improved lipid metabolic profiles and insulin sensitivity5,6. Thus, SCD1 is a pharmacological target in the treatment of obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases7. SCD1 is an integral membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum, and catalyses the formation of a cis-double bond between the ninth and tenth carbons of stearoyl- or palmitoyl-CoA8,9. The reaction requires molecular oxygen, which is activated by a di-iron centre, and cytochrome b5, which regenerates the di-iron centre10. To understand better the structural basis of these characteristics of SCD function, here we crystallize and solve the structure of mouse SCD1 bound to stearoyl-CoA at 2.6 Å resolution. The structure shows a novel fold comprising four transmembrane helices capped by a cytosolic domain, and a plausible pathway for lateral substrate access and product egress. The acyl chain of the bound stearoyl-CoA is enclosed in a tunnel buried in the cytosolic domain, and the geometry of the tunnel and the conformation of the bound acyl chain provide a structural basis for the regioselectivity and stereospecificity of the desaturation reaction. The dimetal centre is coordinated by a unique spacial arrangement of nine conserved histidine residues that implies a potentially novel mechanism for oxygen activation. The structure also illustrates a possible route for electron transfer from cytochrome b5 to the di-iron centre.},

The integral-membrane protein was purified as nearly homogeneous protein vesicles by differential ultracentriftigation and HPLC cation exchange chromatography without the detergent solubilization normally required for membrane proteins. Purified AlkB had specific activity of up to 5 units/mg for octane-dependent NADPH consumption. Mössbauer studies of AlkB showed that it contains an exchange-coupled dinuclear iron cluster of the type found in soluble diiron proteins such as hemerythrin, ribonucleotide reductase, methane monooxygenase, stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) Δ9 desaturase, rubrerythrin, and purple acid phosphatase. In the as-isolated enzyme, the cluster contains an antiferromagnetically coupled pair of high-spin Fe(III) sites, with an occupancy of up to 0.9 cluster per AlkB. The diferric cluster could be reduced by sodium dithionite, and the diferrous state was found to be stable in air. When both O2 and substrate (octane) were added, however, the diferrous cluster was quantitatively reoxidized, proving that the diiron cluster occupies the active site. Mössbauer data on reduced AlkB are consistent with a cluster coordination rich in nitrogen-containing ligands. New sequence analyses indicate that at least 11 nonheme integral-membrane enzymes, including AlkB, contain the 8-histidine motif required for catalytic activity in stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Based on our Mössbauer studies of AlkB, we propose that the integral-membrane enzymes in this family contain diiron clusters. Because these enzymes catalyze a diverse range of oxygenation reactions, this proposal suggests a greatly expanded role for diiron clusters in O2-activation biochemistry.},

The preferred substrates are palmitoyl- and stearoyl-CoA, which are converted into palmitoleoyl- and oleoyl-CoA respectively. Oleate is the most abundant monounsaturated fatty acid in dietary fat and is therefore readily available. Studies of mice that have a naturally occurring mutation in the SCD-1 gene isoform as well as a mouse model with a targeted disruption of the SCD gene (SCD-1-/-) have revealed the role of de novo synthesized oleate and thus the physiological importance of SCD-1 expression. SCD-1 deficiency results in reduced body adiposity, increased insulin sensitivity, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. The expression of several genes of lipid oxidation are upregulated, whereas lipid synthesis genes are downregulated. SCD-1 was also found to be a component of the novel metabolic response to the hormone leptin. Therefore, SCD-1 appears to be an important metabolic control point, and inhibition of its expression could be of benefit for the treatment of obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases.

SCD1 has a diiron center and its proper function requires an electron transport chain composed of NADH (or NADPH), cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R), and cytochrome b5 (cyt b5). Since SCD1 is a key regulator in fat metabolism and is required for survival of cancer cells, there is intense interest in targeting SCD1 for various metabolic diseases and cancers. Crystal structures of human and mouse SCD1 were reported recently; however, both proteins have two zinc ions instead of two iron ions in the catalytic center, and as a result, the enzymes are inactive. Here we report a general approach for incorporating iron into heterologously expressed proteins in HEK293 cells. We produced mouse SCD1 that contains a diiron center and visualized its diiron center by solving its crystal structure to 3.5 Å. We assembled the entire electron transport chain using the purified soluble domains of cyt b5 and b5R, and the purified mouse SCD1, and we showed that three proteins coordinate to produce proper products. These results established an in vitro system that allows precise perturbations of the electron transport chain for the understanding of the catalytic mechanism in SCD1.},

This transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum protein converts saturated fatty acids into monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily stearoyl-CoA into oleoyl- CoA, which are critical products for energy metabolism and membrane composition. The present computational molecular dynamics study characterizes the molecular dynamics of SCD1 with substrate, product, and as an apoprotein. The modeling of SCD1:fatty acid interactions suggests that: (1) SCD1:CoA moiety interactions open the substrate-binding tunnel, (2) SCD1 stabilizes a substrate conformation favorable for desaturation, and (3) SCD1:product interactions result in an opening of the tunnel, possibly allowing product exit into the surrounding membrane. Together, these results describe a highly dynamic series of SCD1 conformations resulting from the enzyme:cofactor:substrate interplay that inform drug-discovery efforts.},

   abstract = {The eukaryotic fatty acid desaturases are iron-containing enzymes that catalyze the NAD-(P)H- and O2-dependent introduction of double bonds into methylene-interrupted fatty acyl chains. Examination of deduced amino acid sequences for the membrane desaturases from mammals, fungi, insects, higher plants, and cyanobacteria has revealed three regions of conserved primary sequence containing HX(3 or 4)H, HX(2 or 3)HH, and HX(2 or 3)HH. This motif is also present in the bacterial membrane enzymes alkane hydroxylase (ω-hydroxylase) and xylene monooxygenase. Hydropathy analyses indicate that these enzymes contain up to three long hydrophobic domains which would be long enough to span the membrane bilayer twice. The conserved His-containing regions have a consistent positioning with respect to these potential membrane spanning domains. Taken together, these observations suggest that the membrane fatty acid desaturases and hydrocarbon hydroxylases have a related protein fold, possibly arising from a common ancestral origin. In order to examine the functional role of these conserved His residues, we have made use of the ability of the rat Δ9 desaturase gene to complement a yeast strain deficient in the Δ9 desaturase gene function (ole1). By site-directed mutagenesis, eight conserved His residues in the rat Δ9 desaturase were individually converted to Ala. Each His → Ala mutation failed to complement the yeast ole1 mutant. In contrast, mutation of three nonconserved flanking His residues or a partially conserved Arg residue within the conserved motif to Ala allowed for complementation of the ole1 phenotype. Western blot analysis showed that steady-state expression levels were equivalent for the wild-type rat desaturase and for all mutants, suggesting that the conserved His residues are essential for catalytic function. One role for these His residues would be to act as ligands for the iron atom(s) contained in these enzymes. On the basis of these results and the presently available spectroscopic data, we recognize the possibility that the membrane desaturases, alkane hydroxylase, and xylene monooxygenase contain a new structural type of diiron center. © 1994, American Chemical Society.

   abstract = {The three purified proteins which are required for microsomal stearyl CoA desaturation, NADH cytochrome b5 reductase, cytochrome b5, and desaturase, have been combined with egg lecithin or dimyristyl lecithin vesicles to reconstruct a functional electron transport system capable of utilizing NADH and O2 in the desaturation of stearyl CoA. Such preparations appear to consist of phospholipid vesicles which contain the three proteins bound to the outer surface of the vesicles. Acyl CoA derivatives containing 12 to 19 carbon fatty acyl chains are required for desaturase activity while derivatives containing 9 to 20 carbons are capable of binding to the enzyme. Shorter chain acyl CoA derivatives, free CoA, and free fatty acids do not appear to bind to the enzyme. Inhibition and analog studies suggest that the methylene chain of stearyl CoA assumes an eclipsed ('gauche') conformation at carbon atoms 9,10 in the enzyme substrate complex. Furthermore, isotope rate effects obtained with deuterated stearyl CoA derivatives indicate that hydrogen removal is the rate limiting step of desaturation. Stearyl CoA binds to pure liposomes and desaturase containing liposomes, and it is this form of stearyl CoA which appears to be the substrate for desaturase. The Arrhenius plots of desaturase activity obtained using desaturase bound to egg lecithin liposomes, in which the liquid crystalline to crystalline phase transition temperature is -5°, was linear between 15 and 35°, while that obtained using desaturase bound to dimyristyl lecithin liposomes showed a break at 24° coinciding with the liquid crystalline to crystalline phase transition temperature for this lipid. The decrease observed in the deuterium isotope rate effect below the transition temperature indicates that a step in the reaction sequence other than hydrogen abstraction becomes rate limiting when the lipid is in the crystalline state. In this system translational diffusion does not emerge as the rate limiting step. The liposomes contained sufficient reductase and cytochrome b5 so that translational diffusion was not rate limiting.},

The SCD1 di-iron core is devised by nine histidines with penta- (FeA) and tetra-coordinations (FeB) mixed. Utilizing density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that SCD1 employs a mechanism unknown previously in other NHFe2 enzymes, which involves the binding of O2/water leading to FeA(II)-•OH + FeB(II)-•OOH, the addition of H+/e forming FeA(II)-water, the O-O bond dissociation assisted by a hydrogen transfer from FeA(II)-water to FeB-bound oxygen to form a unique triple-hydroxyl intermediate of FeA(II)-•OH + FeB(II)-(•OH)2, a hydrogen transfer inside FeB(II)-(•OH)2 resulting in a FeA(II)-•OH and a high-valent FeB(IV)=O, the respective abstraction of the C9- and C10-hydrogens of substrates by FeB(IV)=O and FeA(II)-•OH producing alkene, and the regeneration of FeB(II)-•OH to FeB(II)-(OH2)2 with another H+/e added. The remote di-iron mixed with penta- and tetra-coordinations cooperates closely and achieves a good reactivity balance between O-O dissociation and hydrogen abstraction. The activity order of various Fe-containing species in the aliphatic C-H bond activation was obtained. Other important mechanistic characteristics and chemistry were also revealed. Our investigation lays a foundation for the design of low-cost and easily synthesized biomimetic catalysts for the aliphatic C-H bond activation, such as homogeneous di-Fe(II) complexes with pure N-containing ligands and heterogeneous porous Fe(II)-N metal-organic frameworks.},

Here, a systematic overview of recent achievements and key literature of integral membrane desaturases is provided in the context of biotechnological potential of the enzyme family. Practical Application: Integral membrane fatty acid desaturases may be the most promising tool to increase the scope of fatty acids as platform chemicals. Plant oil production is well researched and an established sustainable pathway toward high-yield chemicals. In addition, effort is increasing toward creating microbial high-yield oil producers.

   abstract = {In contrast to soluble acyl-ACP desaturases from plants, little is known about the structure-guiding principle underlying substrate specificity and regioselectivity of membrane-bound acyl-CoA desaturases from animals, mainly due to lack of the three-dimensional structure information. Here we report identification of two homologous membrane-bound acyl-CoA Δ9 desaturases (ChDes9-1 and ChDes9-2) from the marine copepod Calanus hyperboreus that accumulates more than 90\% of total storage lipids in the form of wax esters. ChDes9-2 is a common Δ9 desaturase with substrate specificity to long chain fatty acid 18:0, while ChDes9-1 is a new type of Δ9 desaturase introducing a Δ9 double bond into a wide range of very long chain fatty acids ranging from 20:0 to 26:0. Reciprocal domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis guided by the membrane topology revealed that presence or absence of an amphipathic and bulky residue, tyrosine, in the middle of the second transmembrane domain was important in determining the substrate specificity of the two desaturases. To examine the mechanistic structure for the substrate specificity, tyrosine-scanning mutagenesis was employed to systematically substitute the residues in the transmembrane domain of the very long chain desaturase. The results showed that the transmembrane domain formed an α-helix structure probably involved in formation of the substrate-binding pocket and the corresponding residue of the tyrosine likely resided at the critical position within the pocket mediating the interaction with the substrates, thereby specifying the chain length of the substrates. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

However, in many African populations like the Tai strain, females possess low levels of 7,11 HD and high levels of its positional isomer 5,9 HD. We have previously isolated a desaturase gene, desat1, from the Canton-S strain (CS), a 7,11 HD-2-rich morph of D. melanogaster. This desaturase is located in 87C, a locus that has been involved in the difference between 7,11 HD and 5,9 HD morphs. Therefore, we have searched for different desaturase isoforms in both strains. We first cloned desat1 in the Tai strain and report here functional expression of desat1 in CS and Tai. In both strains, the Desat1 enzymes have the same Δ9 specificity and preferentially use palmitate as a substrate, leading to the synthesis of w7 fatty acids. Also found was a desaturase sequence, named desat2, with a homologous catalytic domain and a markedly different N-terminal domain compared with desat1. In CS genome, it lies 3.8 kb upstream of desat1 and is not transcribed in either sex. In the Tai strain, it is expressed only in females and acts preferentially on myristate, leading to the synthesis of w5 fatty acids. We suggest, therefore, that desat2 might play a control role in the biosynthesis of 5,9 HD hydrocarbons in Tai females and could explain the dienic hydrocarbon polymorphism in D. melanogaster.},

The protection from obesity involves increased energy expenditure and increased oxygen consumption. Compared with the wild-type mice the SCD1-/- mice have increased levels of plasma ketone bodies but reduced levels of plasma insulin and leptin. In the SCD1-/- mice, the expression of several genes of lipid oxidation are up-regulated, whereas lipid synthesis genes are down-regulated.

   abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review evaluates recent findings on the mechanisms by which lipogenic enzymes are upregulated or activated in cancer cells, the implications of increased lipogenesis for cancer cell biology and the feasibility of exploiting this pathway and its regulators as targets for antineoplastic intervention. RECENT FINDINGS: The list of cancer types showing increased lipogenic enzyme expression keeps growing and further evidence is accumulating that growth factor signaling and particularly activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/protein kinase B pathway plays a role in this process. This signaling pathway stimulates lipogenic gene transcription through activation of the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 and directly activates lipogenic enzymes such as ATP-citrate lyase, linking the upregulation of lipogenesis in cancer cells to the well known tumor-associated increase in glycolysis. Steroid hormones, overexpression of the ubiquitin-specific protease-2a and mutations in breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 may further enhance lipid synthesis. While fatty acid synthase is further established as a target for antineoplastic intervention, recent findings show that interference with acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α, ATP citrate lyase or the AMP-activated protein kinase limits cancer cell proliferation and survival. SUMMARY: The same disturbances in signaling pathways responsible for oncogenic transformation may also contribute to the increased lipogenesis observed in tumor cells. Increased lipogenesis involves modulation of multiple lipogenic enzymes at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional level and is linked to other cancer-associated metabolic changes. Not only fatty acid synthase, but in fact all key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis as well as key metabolic regulators are potential targets for antineoplastic intervention. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

   abstract = {Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is an essential regulator of fatty acid synthesis. We have previously shown that overexpression of SCD1 increases the growth of breast cancer cell lines. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between SCD1 expression level and clinical-pathologic characteristics and survival of patients with breast cancer. Fine-needle aspirates were collected from the primary tumors of 250 patients with stage I-III breast cancer. Demographic and clinical characteristics including patient age, ethnicity, and menopausal status and tumor clinical stage, grade, and subtype were reviewed. SCD1 expression was analyzed using reverse-phase protein arrays. Samples were divided into high or low SCD1 expression levels based on a cut-off determined from martingale residual plots and regression tree analysis. SCD1 levels were significantly higher in tumors from patients >50-years old compared to patients ≤50-years old and were lower in triple-negative (estrogen/progesterone receptor-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative) breast cancers than other tumor subtypes. After adjusting for patient age, tumor subtype, tumor grade, and clinical stage, we found that patients with primary breast cancers expressing high SCD1 levels had significantly shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.0140) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.039) in multivariable analysis. We conclude that SCD1 expression varies by breast cancer subtype and that high levels of SCD1 expression are associated with significantly shorter RFS and OS in multivariable analysis. Future studies are needed to define the role of SCD1 in the malignant phenotype of breast cancer and to evaluate the potential for SCD1 as a therapeutic target. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

   abstract = {Bladder cancer is a common disease and a significant cause of death worldwide. There is thus great interest in identifying a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, as well as gaining an understanding of the molecular basis of bladder cancer. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gene (SCD1) is highly overexpressed in many human cancers. However, the expression of SCD1 has not yet been investigated in patients with bladder cancer. Here, we document that (a) the SCD1 is highly overexpressed in human bladder cancer; (b) high expression of SCD1 is more frequently observed in the late stage of disease and patients with lymph node metastasis; (c) bladder cancer patients with a higher SCD1 mRNA level have a poorer survival rate than those with normal SCD1 expression. Overall, this is the first report to indicate an association between SCD1 mRNA level and clinical indicators of human bladder cancer. Our study has provided evidence supporting the potential role of SCD1 as a biomarker for human bladder cancer prognosis.},

These cells are most commonly found in the skin in association with hair follicles (forming the pilosebaceous unit), where they arise from hair follicle keratinocytes, but there are also sebaceous glands (SGs) not associated with a hair follicle. The latter have special functions as secretion of pheromones or corneal protection. While the full range of sebum functions in human skin remains to be clarified, sebum forms an integral component of the epidermal barrier and the skin immune system. Sebocyte formation is controlled by multiple molecular pathways (e.g. Blimp1, Wnt, C-myc, Hedgehog) and sebum synthesis is strongly regulated by hormones, in particular by androgens. Excessive sebum production is seen in acne vulgaris, one of the most common skin diseases, while deregulated sebocyte differentiation characterizes some rare benign and malignant tumors. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Three well-characterized isoforms of SCD, SCD1, SCD2 and SCD3, exist in mice. To investigate the physiologic functions of SCD1, we generated SCD1 null (SCD1 -/-) mice. The skin and eyelid of SCD1 -/- mice are deficient in triglycerides and cholesterol esters, and the eyelid also is deficient in wax esters. Furthermore, the eyelid and skin of SCD1 -/- mice have higher levels of free cholesterol. SCD1 -/- mice develop cutaneous abnormalities and narrow eye fissure with atrophic sebaceous and meibomian glands. Consumption of diets containing high levels of oleate, failed to restore the levels of triglycerides, cholesterol esters and wax esters in SCD1 -/- mice to the levels found in the eyelid of wild-type mice. These results reveal a physiologic role of SCD in cholesterol homeostasis as well as in the de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol esters, triglycerides and wax esters required for normal skin and eyelid function.},

   abstract = {Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is a microsomal enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of oleate and palmitoleate. Mice with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 isoform (SCD1-/) exhibit reduced adiposity and increased energy expenditure. To address whether the energy expenditure is attributable to increased thermogenesis, we investigated the effect of SCD1 deficiency on basal and cold-induced thermogenesis. SCD1-/ mice have increased expression of uncoupling proteins in brown adipose tissue (BAT) relative to controls. The β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) expression was increased and the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein and the protein level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α were increased in the SCD1-/ mice. Both lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation were increased in the SCD1-/ mice. When exposed to 4°C, SCD1-/- mice showed hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and depleted liver glycogen. High levels of dietary oleate partially compensated for the hypothermia and rescued plasma glucose and liver glycogen. These results suggest that SCD1 deficiency stimulates basal thermogenesis through the upregulation of the β3-AR-mediated pathway and a subsequent increase in lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in BAT. The hypothermia and hypoglycemia in cold-exposed SCD1-/- mice and the compensatory recovery by oleate indicate an important role of SCD1 gene expression in thermoregulation.},

These compounds were metabolized in these sensitive cells by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP4F11 into potent inhibitors of stearoyl CoA desaturase. A hallmark of targeted cancer therapies is selective toxicity among cancer cell lines. We evaluated results from a viability screen of over 200,000 small molecules to identify two chemical series, oxalamides and benzothiazoles, that were selectively toxic at low nanomolar concentrations to the same 4 of 12 human lung cancer cell lines. Sensitive cell lines expressed cytochrome P450 (CYP) 4F11, which metabolized the compounds into irreversible inhibitors of stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD). SCD is recognized as a promising biological target in cancer and metabolic disease. However, SCD is essential to sebocytes, and accordingly SCD inhibitors cause skin toxicity. Mouse sebocytes did not activate the benzothiazoles or oxalamides into SCD inhibitors, providing a therapeutic window for inhibiting SCD in vivo. We thus offer a strategy to target SCD in cancer by taking advantage of high CYP expression in a subset of tumors.},

They mediate the metabolic activation of numerous precarcinogens and participate in the inactivation and activation of anticancer drugs. Since all CYPs that metabolize xenobiotics are polymorphic, much emphasis has been put on the investigation of a relationship between the distribution of specific variant CYP alleles and risk for different types of cancer, but a consistent view does not yet exist. This is to a great extent explained by the fact that the CYPs involved in activation of precarcinogens are in general not functionally polymorphic. This is in contrast to CYPs that are active in drug biotransformation where large interindividual differences in the capacity to metabolize therapeutic drugs are seen as a consequence of polymorphic alleles with altered function. This includes also some anticancer drugs like tamoxifen and cyclophosphamide metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP2B6. Some P450 forms are also selectively expressed in tumours, and this could provide a mechanism for drug resistance, but also future therapies using these enzymes as drug targets can be envisioned.

   abstract = {Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), a critical regulator of energy metabolism, catalyzes the synthesis of monounsaturated fats. To understand the tissue-specific role of SCD1 in energy homeostasis, we used Cre-lox technology to generate mice with a liver-specific knockout of Scd1 (LKO). LKO mice were protected from high-carbohydrate, but not high-fat (HF), diet-induced adiposity and hepatic steatosis. Additionally, on a high-sucrose, very low-fat (HSVLF) diet, lipogenesis and levels of nuclear SREBP-1 and ChREBP were significantly decreased in the livers of LKO relative to Scd1lox/lox (Lox) mice. HSVLF feeding in LKO mice caused hypoglycemia and hepatic carbohydrate reduction due to an impairment of gluconeogenesis. Oleate, but not stearate, supplementation normalized adiposity, gluconeogenesis, triglyceride secretion, and hepatic lipogenesis of LKO mice. These results indicate that hepatic SCD1 expression (and thus, oleate) is required for carbohydrate-induced adiposity, but SCD1 inhibition in extrahepatic tissues is required to protect mice from HF-induced obesity and insulin resistance. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {We present a new approach to generating electrostatic potential (ESP) derived charges for molecules. The major strength of electrostatic potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the intermolecular interaction properties of molecules with a simple two-body additive potential, provided, of course, that a suitably accurate level of quantum mechanical calculation is used to derive the ESP around the molecule. Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules, they have often been conformationally dependent, and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramolecular interactions. Introducing restraints in the form of a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems, with only a minor decrease in the quality of the fit to the quantum mechanical ESP. Several other refinements in addition to the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit yield a general and algorithmic charge fitting procedure for generating atom-centered point charges. This approach can thus be recommended for general use in molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculations for any organic or bioorganic system. © 1993 American Chemical Society.},

In the second part, we take a different look at coarse graining by analyzing conformations of molecules. This is done by the application of self-organizing maps, i.e., a neural network type approach. Such an approach can be used to guide the selection of the relevant degrees of freedom. Then, we discuss technical issues related to the popular dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) method. Importantly, the potentials derived using the inverse Monte Carlo method can be used together with the DPD thermostat.

   abstract = {The Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM), an extension of Ferrenberg and Swendsen's Multiple Histogram Technique, has been applied for the first time on complex biomolecular Hamiltonians. The method is presented here as an extension of the Umbrella Sampling method for free‐energy and Potential of Mean Force calculations. This algorithm possesses the following advantages over methods that are currently employed: (1) It provides a built‐in estimate of sampling errors thereby yielding objective estimates of the optimal location and length of additional simulations needed to achieve a desired level of precision; (2) it yields the “best” value of free energies by taking into account all the simulations so as to minimize the statistical errors; (3) in addition to optimizing the links between simulations, it also allows multiple overlaps of probability distributions for obtaining better estimates of the free‐energy differences. By recasting the Ferrenberg–Swendsen Multiple Histogram equations in a form suitable for molecular mechanics type Hamiltonians, we have demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of this method by applying it to a test problem of the generation of the Potential of Mean Force profile of the pseudorotation phase angle of the sugar ring in deoxyadenosine. © 1992 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

   abstract = {The importance of iron in living systems can be traced to the many complexes within which it is found, to its chemical mobility in undergoing oxidation-reduction reactions, and to the abundance of iron in Earth's crust. Iron is the most abundant element, by mass, in the Earth, constituting about 80\% of the inner and outer cores of Earth. The molten outer core is about 8000 km in diameter, and the solid inner core is about 2400 km in diameter. Iron is the fourth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It is the chemically functional component of mononuclear iron complexes, dinuclear iron complexes, [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, [Fe-Ni-S] clusters, iron protophorphyrin IX, and many other complexes in protein biochemistry. Metals such as nickel, cobalt, copper, and manganese are present in the crust and could in principle function chemically in place of iron, but they are scarce in Earth's crust. Iron is plentiful because of its nuclear stability in stellar nuclear fusion reactions. It seems likely that other solid planets, formed by the same processes as Earth, would also foster the evolution of life and that iron would be similarly important to life on those planets as it is on Earth. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

The atomic partial charges in GAFF and the second generation of GAFF (GAFF2) were originally developed with the quantum mechanics derived restrained electrostatic potential charge, but in practice, users usually adopt an efficient charge method, Austin Model 1-bond charge corrections (AM1-BCC), based on which, without expensive ab initio calculations, the atomic charges could be efficiently and conveniently obtained with the ANTECHAMBER module implemented in the AMBER software package. In this work, we developed a new set of BCC parameters specifically for GAFF2 using 442 neutral organic solutes covering diverse functional groups in aqueous solution. Compared to the original BCC parameter set, the new parameter set significantly reduced the mean unsigned error (MUE) of hydration free energies from 1.03 kcal/mol to 0.37 kcal/mol. More excitingly, this new AM1-BCC model also showed excellent performance in the solvation free energy (SFE) calculation on diverse solutes in various organic solvents across a range of different dielectric constants. In this large-scale test with totally 895 neutral organic solvent-solute systems, the new parameter set led to accurate SFE predictions with the MUE and the root-mean-square-error of 0.51 kcal/mol and 0.65 kcal/mol, respectively. This newly developed charge model, ABCG2, paved a promising path for the next generation GAFF development.},

   abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become increasingly popular in studying the motions and functions of biomolecules. The accuracy of the simulation, however, is highly determined by the molecular mechanics (MM) force field (FF), a set of functions with adjustable parameters to compute the potential energies from atomic positions. However, the overall quality of the FF, such as our previously published ff99SB and ff14SB, can be limited by assumptions that were made years ago. In the updated model presented here (ff19SB), we have significantly improved the backbone profiles for all 20 amino acids. We fit coupled Ï†/ψ parameters using 2D ψ conformational scans for multiple amino acids, using as reference data the entire 2D quantum mechanics (QM) energy surface. We address the polarization inconsistency during dihedral parameter fitting by using both QM and MM in aqueous solution. Finally, we examine possible dependency of the backbone fitting on side chain rotamer. To extensively validate ff19SB parameters, and to compare to results using other Amber models, we have performed a total of â¼5 ms MD simulations in explicit solvent. Our results show that after amino-acid-specific training against QM data with solvent polarization, ff19SB not only reproduces the differences in amino-acid-specific Protein Data Bank (PDB) Ramachandran maps better but also shows significantly improved capability to differentiate amino-acid-dependent properties such as helical propensities. We also conclude that an inherent underestimation of helicity is present in ff14SB, which is (inexactly) compensated for by an increase in helical content driven by the TIP3P bias toward overly compact structures. In summary, ff19SB, when combined with a more accurate water model such as OPC, should have better predictive power for modeling sequence-specific behavior, protein mutations, and also rational protein design. Of the explicit water models tested here, we recommend use of OPC with ff19SB.},

Here, we contribute to filling the gap by reporting melting temperatures of ice Ih of OPC and OPC3 water models. Through the direct coexistence method, which we make available in the AMBER package, the melting points of OPC and OPC3 are estimated as 242 and 210 K, similar to TIP4P-Ew and SPC/E models, respectively, and appreciably below the experimental value of 273.15 K under 1 bar pressure. Water models of the OPC family were optimized to best reproduce water properties in the liquid phase where these models offer noteworthy accuracy advantages over many models of previous generations. It is not surprising that the accuracy of OPC models in describing the phase transition to the solid state does not appear to offer similar improvements. The new anisotropic barostat option implemented in AMBER may benefit system preparation and simulation outside of the direct coexistence applications, such as modeling of membranes or very long DNA strands.},

   abstract = {Monovalent ions play significant roles in various biological and material systems. Recently, four new water models (OPC3, OPC, TIP3P-FB, and TIP4P-FB), with significantly improved descriptions of condensed phase water, have been developed. The pairwise interaction between the metal ion and water necessitates the development of ion parameters specifically for these water models. Herein, we parameterized the 12-6 and the 12-6-4 nonbonded models for 12 monovalent ions with the respective four new water models. These monovalent ions contain eight cations including alkali metal ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+), transition-metal ions (Cu+ and Ag+), and Tl+ from the boron family, along with four halide anions (F-, Cl-, Br-, I-). Our parameters were designed to reproduce the target hydration free energies (the 12-6 hydration free energy (HFE) set), the ion-oxygen distances (the 12-6 ion-oxygen distance (IOD) set), or both of them (the 12-6-4 set). The 12-6-4 parameter set provides highly accurate structural features overcoming the limitations of the routinely used 12-6 nonbonded model for ions. Specifically, we note that the 12-6-4 parameter set is able to reproduce experimental hydration free energies within 1 kcal/mol and experimental ion-oxygen distances within 0.01 Å simultaneously. We further reproduced the experimentally determined activity derivatives for salt solutions, validating the ion parameters for simulations of ion pairs. The improved performance of the present water models over our previous parameter sets for the TIP3P, TIP4P, and SPC/E water models (Li, P. et al J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2015 11 1645 1657) highlights the importance of the choice of water model in conjunction with the metal ion parameter set.},

   abstract = {The utility of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model biomolecular structure, dynamics, and interactions has witnessed enormous advances in recent years due to the availability of optimized MD software and access to significant computational power, including GPU multicore computing engines and other specialized hardware. This has led researchers to routinely extend conformational sampling times to the microsecond level and beyond. The extended sampling time has allowed the community not only to converge conformational ensembles through complete sampling but also to discover deficiencies and overcome problems with the force fields. Accuracy of the force fields is a key component, along with sampling, toward being able to generate accurate and stable structures of biopolymers. The Amber force field for nucleic acids has been used extensively since the 1990s, and multiple artifacts have been discovered, corrected, and reassessed by different research groups. We present a direct comparison of two of the most recent and state-of-the-art Amber force field modifications, bsc1 and OL15, that focus on accurate modeling of double-stranded DNA. After extensive MD simulations with five test cases and two different water models, we conclude that both modifications are a remarkable improvement over the previous bsc0 force field. Both force field modifications show better agreement when compared to experimental structures. To ensure convergence, the Drew-Dickerson dodecamer (DDD) system was simulated using 100 independent MD simulations, each extended to at least 10 μs, and the independent MD simulations were concatenated into a single 1 ms long trajectory for each combination of force field and water model. This is significantly beyond the time scale needed to converge the conformational ensemble of the internal portions of a DNA helix absent internal base pair opening. Considering all of the simulations discussed in the current work, the MD simulations performed to assess and validate the current force fields and water models aggregate over 14 ms of simulation time. The results suggest that both the bsc1 and OL15 force fields render average structures that deviate significantly less than 1 Å from the average experimental structures. This can be compared to similar but less exhaustive simulations with the CHARMM 36 force field that aggregate to the ∼90 μs time scale and also perform well but do not produce structures as close to the DDD NMR average structures (with root-mean-square deviations of 1.3 Å) as the newer Amber force fields. On the basis of these analyses, any future research involving double-stranded DNA simulations using the Amber force fields should employ the bsc1 or OL15 modification.},

They also improve the description of the syn region and the syn-anti balance as well as enhance MD simulations of various RNA structures. Although ξOL can be combined with both ff99 and ff99bsc0, we recommend the latter. We do not recommend using ξOL for B-DNA because it does not improve upon ff99bsc0 for canonical structures. However, it might be useful in simulations of DNA molecules containing syn nucleotides. Our parametrization is based on high-level QM calculations and differs from conventional parametrization approaches in that it incorporates some previously neglected solvation-related effects (which appear to be essential for obtaining correct anti/high-anti balance).

   abstract = {A new derivation of the GLYCAM06 force field, which removes its previous specificity for carbohydrates, and its dependency on the AMBER force field and parameters, is presented. AU pertinent force field terms have been explicitly specified and so no default or generic parameters are employed. The new GLYCAM is no longer limited to any particular class of biomolecules, but is extendible to all molecular classes in the spirit of a smallmolecule force field. The torsion terms in the present work were all derived from quantum mechanical data from a collection of minimal molecular fragments and related small molecules. For carbohydrates, there is now a single parameter set applicable to both α- and β-anomers and to all monosaccharide ring sizes and conformations. We demonstrate that deriving dihedral parameters by fitting to QM data for internal rotational energy curves for representative small molecules generally leads to correct rotamer populations in molecular dynamics simulations, and that this approach removes the need for phase corrections in the dihedral terms. However, we note that there are cases where this approach is inadequate. Reported here are the basic components of the new force field as well as an illustration of its extension to carbohydrates. In addition to reproducing the gas-phase properties of an array of small test molecules, condensed-phase simulations employing GLYCAM06 are shown to reproduce rotamer populations for key small molecules and representative biopolymer building blocks in explicit water, as well as crystalline lattice properties, such as unit cell dimensions, and vibrational frequencies. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The essential novelty in this so-called GFN2-xTB method is the inclusion of anisotropic second order density fluctuation effects via short-range damped interactions of cumulative atomic multipole moments. Without noticeable increase in the computational demands, this results in a less empirical and overall more physically sound method, which does not require any classical halogen or hydrogen bonding corrections and which relies solely on global and element-specific parameters (available up to radon, Z = 86). Moreover, the atomic partial charge dependent D4 London dispersion model is incorporated self-consistently, which can be naturally obtained in a tight-binding picture from second order density fluctuations. Fully analytical and numerically precise gradients (nuclear forces) are implemented. The accuracy of the method is benchmarked for a wide variety of systems and compared with other semiempirical methods. Along with excellent performance for the "target" properties, we also find lower errors for "off-target" properties such as barrier heights and molecular dipole moments. High computational efficiency along with the improved physics compared to its precursor GFN-xTB makes this method well-suited to explore the conformational space of molecular systems. Significant improvements are furthermore observed for various benchmark sets, which are prototypical for biomolecular systems in aqueous solution.},

   abstract = {The structure and function of macromolecules depend critically on the ionization (protonation) states of their acidic and basic groups. A number of existing practical methods predict protonation equilibrium pK constants of macromolecules based upon their atomic resolution Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures; the calculations are often performed within the framework of the continuum electrostatics model. Unfortunately, these methodologies are complex, involve multiple steps and require considerable investment of effort. Our web server http:// biophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++ provides access to a tool that automates this process, allowing both experts and novices to quickly obtain estimates of pKs as well as other related characteristics of biomolecules such as isoelectric points, titration curves and energies of protonation microstates. Protons are added to the input structure according to the calculated ionization states of its titratable groups at the user-specified pH; the output is in the PQR (PDB + charges + radii) format. In addition, corresponding coordinate and topology files are generated in the format supported by the molecular modeling package AMBER. The server is intended for a broad community of biochemists, molecular modelers, structural biologists and drug designers; it can also be used as an educational tool in biochemistry courses. © 2005 Oxford University Press.},

   abstract = {Structure and function of macromolecules depend critically on the ionization states of their acidic and basic groups. Most current structure-based theoretical methods that predict pK of ionizable groups in macromolecules include, as one of the key steps, a computation of the partition sum (Boltzmann average) over all possible protonation microstates. As the number of these microstates depends exponentially on the number of ionizable groups present in the molecule, direct computation of the sum is not realistically feasible for many typical proteins that may have tens or even hundreds of ionizable groups. We have tested a simple and robust approximate algorithm for computing these partition sums for macromolecules. The method subdivides the interacting sites into independent clusters, based upon the strength of site-site electrostatic interaction. The resulting partition function is factorizable into computationally manageable components. Two variants of the approach are presented and validated on a representative test set of 602 proteins, by comparing the pK1/2 values computed by the proposed method with those obtained by the standard Monte Carlo approach used as a reference. With 95\% confidence, the relative error introduced by the more accurate of the two methods is less than 0.25 pK units. The algorithms are one to two orders of magnitude faster than the Monte Carlo method, with the typical settings. A graphical representation is introduced that visualizes the clusters of strong site-site interactions in the contest of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the macromolecule, facilitating identification of functionally important clusters of ionizable groups; the approach is exemplified on two proteins, bacteriorhodopsin and myoglobin. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This Review focuses on classical metal ion modeling based on unpolarized models (including the nonbonded, bonded, cationic dummy atom, and combined models), polarizable models (e.g., the fluctuating charge, Drude oscillator, and the induced dipole models), the angular overlap model, and valence bond-based models. Quantum mechanical studies of metal ion-containing systems at the semiempirical, ab initio, and density functional levels of theory are reviewed as well with a particular focus on how these methods inform classical modeling efforts. Finally, conclusions and future prospects and directions are offered that will further enhance the classical modeling of metal ion-containing systems.},

Bilayer parameters, such as area per lipid and overall bilayer thickness have been obtained in conjunction with intrabilayer structural parameters (e.g. hydrocarbon region thickness). The results have allowed us to assess the effect of temperature and hydrocarbon chain composition on bilayer structure. For example, we found that for all lipids there is, not surprisingly, an increase in fatty acid chain trans-gauche isomerization with increasing temperature. Moreover, this increase in trans-gauche isomerization scales with fatty acid chain length in mixed chain lipids. However, in the case of lipids with saturated fatty acid chains, trans-gauche isomerization is increasingly tempered by attractive chain-chain van der Waals interactions with increasing chain length. Finally, our results confirm a strong dependence of lipid chain dynamics as a function of double bond position along fatty acid chains. Copyright © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {For molecular dynamics simulations of biological membrane systems to live up to the potential of providing accurate atomic level detail into membrane properties and functions, it is essential that the force fields used to model such systems are as accurate as possible. One membrane property that is often used to assess force field accuracy is the carbon-hydrogen (or carbon-deuterium) order parameters of the lipid tails, which can be accurately measured using experimental NMR techniques. There are a variety of analysis tools available to calculate these order parameters from simulations and it is essential that these computational tools work correctly to ensure the accurate assessment of the simulation force fields. In this work we compare many of these computational tools for calculating the order parameters of POPC membranes. While tools that work on all-Atom systems and tools that work on saturated lipid tails in general work extremely well, we demonstrate that the majority of the tested tools that calculate the order parameters for unsaturated united-Atom lipid tails do so incorrectly. We identify tools that do perform accurate calculations and include one such program with this work, enabling rapid and accurate calculation of united-Atom lipid order parameters. Furthermore, we discuss cases in which it is nontrivial to appropriately predict the unsaturated carbon order parameters in united-Atom systems. Finally, we examine order parameter splitting for carbon 2 in sn-2 lipid chains, demonstrating substantial deviations from experimental values in several all-Atom and united-Atom lipid force fields.},

   abstract = {The influence of cis and trans double bonds on the hydrocarbon-chain organization of fluid lipid bilayers is investigated by means of deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance. Oleic acid and elaidic acid have been deuterated selectively at six and three different carbon atoms, respectively, The labeled fatty acids are used to prepare 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-, 1-palmitoyl-2-elaidoyl-, and 1,2-dielaidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. The residual deuterium quadrupole splittings of the fully hydrated bilayer membranes are measured as a function of temperature. An unusual deuterium order profile is obtained for the cis unsaturated phospholipid membrane. However, taking into account geometric effects, the segmental fluctuations in the sn-1 and sn-2 chain are found to be identical. As a general conclusion, it follows that the segmental fluctuations around the bilayer normal depend only on the distance from the lipid-water interface but not on the specific segment geometry. Conformational differences are observed at the beginning of the two chains in bilayers of 1 -palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. The sn-1 chain assumes a straight conformation, while the sn-2 chain is bent at the C-2ʹ segment. The average orientation of the cis double bond in the membrane can be determined by combining the deuterium NMR results with infrared dichroism data. The C=C bond vector is found to be aligned almost perpendicular to the bilayer surface; i.e., the angle between the bilayer normal and the C=C bond vector is only 7-8°. A similar orientation is likely for the trans double bond. © 1978, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The thermotropic behavior and molecular properties of l-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-dihydrosterculoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (PDSPE) have been investigated by 2H NMR spectroscopy using samples selectively labeled at the 5′-, 9′-, 10′-, and 16′-positions of the sn-2 chains. Comparison with the corresponding phosphocholine analogues (POPC and PDSPC), obtained as intermediate synthetic products, was used to monitor the role of the polar head group. Replacement of the choline moiety by ethanolamine increased the gel to liquid-crystal transition temperature by 10-32 °C and led to a significantly higher ordering of the fatty acyl chains in the liquid-crystalline bilayer state. The lateral compression effect, due to the smaller area per polar head group in PE, results in a bilayer to hexagonal phase transition at elevated temperatures. The effects on both PC and PE due to replacement of the olefinic group by a cyclopropane unit are similar. A decrease in the temperature of the gel to liquid-crystal phase transition, Tc, is observed upon introduction of a cyclopropane ring; it goes from 26 °C in POPE to ≈10 °C in PDSPE. In addition, a very significant broadening of the transition profile is observed. These observations are consistent with the poor packing ability of mixed saturated and cyclopropane-containing chains due to the bulky substituent effect. The temperature of the bilayer-hexagonal phase transition of PE samples was decreased by 15-20 °C on replacement of oleoyl chains by dihydrosterculoyl chains at the sn-2 position. These effects of dihydrosterculic acid have been tentatively correlated with the observation that most of the olefinic chains are replaced by the cyclopropane analogue when certain microorganisms enter the stationary phase of their growth cycle or respond to differing environmental conditions. According to what is observed in biologically relevant model compounds, it may be assumed that this transformation will prevent the lipid molecules from entering the nonviable gel state as well as allow the membrane to contain small proportions of lipid molecules in nonbilayer structures. It also confers a lesser temperature sensitivity of the acyl chain order parameter. © 1985, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract This review covers a family of atomistic, mostly quantum chemistry (QC) based semiempirical methods for the fast and reasonably accurate description of large molecules in gas and condensed phase. The theory is derived from a density functional (DFT) perturbation expansion of the electron density in fluctuation terms to various orders similar to the original density functional tight binding model. The term “eXtended” in their name (xTB) emphasizes the parameter availability for almost the entire periodic table of elements (Z ≤ 86) and improvements of the underlying theory regarding, for example, the atomic orbital basis set, the level of multipole approximation and the treatment of the important electrostatic and dispersion interactions. A common feature of most members is their consistent parameterization on accurate gas phase theoretical reference data for geometries, vibrational frequencies and noncovalent interactions, which are the primary properties of interest in typical applications to systems composed of up to a few thousand atoms. Further specialized versions were developed for the description of electronic spectra and corresponding response properties. Besides a provided common theoretical background with some important implementation details in the efficient and free xtb program, various benchmarks for structural and thermochemical properties including (transition-)metal systems are discussed. The review is completed by recent extensions of the model to the force-field (FF) level as well as its application to solids under periodic boundary conditions. The general applicability together with the excellent cost-accuracy ratio and the high robustness make the xTB family of methods very attractive for various fields of computer-aided chemical research.

   abstract = {Low-spin/high-spin energy splittings for Fe(II) transition-metal complexes - particularly in weak ligand fields - cannot be well described by density functional methods. Different density functional yield results which differ by up to 1 eV in transition-metal complexes with sulfur-rich first coordination spheres. We attribute this failure to the fact that the high-spin state is systematically favoured in Hartree - Fock-type theories, because Fermi correlation is included in the exact exchange, while Coulomb correlation is not. We thus expect that the admixture of exact exchange to a given density functional will heavily influence the energy splitting between states of different multiplicity. We demonstrate that the energy splitting depends linearly on the coefficient of exact exchange admixture. This remarkable result is found for all the Fe(II) - S complexes studied. From this observation we conclude in connection with experimental results that Becke's 20\% admixture should be reduced to about 15\% if meaningful energetics are sought for transition-metal compounds. We rationalize that this reduction by 5\% will not affect the quality of the hybrid functional since we arrive at a slightly modified functional, which lies between the pure density functional and the hybrid density functional, which both give good results for "standard" systems.},

The latter were obtained by (partly) modifying bases developed previously. A large set of more than 300 molecules representing (nearly) all elements—except lanthanides—in their common oxidation states was used to assess the quality of the bases all across the periodic table. Quantities investigated were atomization energies, dipole moments and structure parameters for Hartree–Fock, density functional theory and correlated methods, for which we had chosen Møller–Plesset perturbation theory as an example. Finally recommendations are given which type of basis set is used best for a certain level of theory and a desired quality of results.},

@article{Grimme2010,
   abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%-40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},
