  abstract = {Adenosine 5`-triphosphate (ATP) is a basic energy carrier in cellular metabolism. As a high-energy intermediate, it provides a way to convert energy from one biochemical process to another via an environment-dependent hydrolysis reaction. Two paths for ATP hydrolysis in water with Mg2+ are studied here using the density functional method:\, an associative reaction involving a nucleophilic attack of one water molecule, and a dissociative reaction involving a scission of the terminal bridging P-O bond. The latter has an activation energy of 35 kcal/mol, where 25 kcal/mol can be assigned to the P-O bond breaking and 10 kcal/mol to the artificial stability of PO3- resulting from the small size and the short time scale of the simulation. The path and energy barrier (39 kcal/mol) of the less-favorable associative reaction suggest that it is possible only under conditions where the lytic water is already deprotonated to OH-. The Mg cation elongates the terminal bridging P-O bond when forming a bidentate chelate with the two terminal phosphates. Additional constrained displacements of Mg2+ with respect to the nearest phosphate oxygens show that a direct electrophilic attack of Mg toward a bridging O is possible.},

The snap increase in the amount and breadth of related research has come at the price of little systematization of knowledge and attention to earlier literature. This work is a tutorial introduction to the field of deep learning for graphs. It favors a consistent and progressive presentation of the main concepts and architectural aspects over an exposition of the most recent literature, for which the reader is referred to available surveys. The paper takes a top-down view of the problem, introducing a generalized formulation of graph representation learning based on a local and iterative approach to structured information processing. Moreover, it introduces the basic building blocks that can be combined to design novel and effective neural models for graphs. We complement the methodological exposition with a discussion of interesting research challenges and applications in the field.},

Here, we studied the effect of polyP on mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation and activity of F0F1-ATPsynthase. We have found that polyP activates mitochondrial respiration which does not coupled with ATP production (V2) but inhibits ADP-dependent respiration (V3). Moreover, PolyP can stimulate F0F1-ATPase activity in the presence of ATP and, importantly, can be hydrolyzed in this enzyme instead of ATP. Furthermore, PolyP can be produced in mitochondria in the presence of substrates for respiration and phosphate by the F0F1-ATPsynthase. Thus, polyP is an energy molecule in mammalian cells which can be produced and hydrolyzed in the mitochondrial F0F1-ATPsynthase.},

  abstract = {This review covers a family of atomistic, mostly quantum chemistry (QC) based semiempirical methods for the fast and reasonably accurate description of large molecules in gas and condensed phase. The theory is derived from a density functional (DFT) perturbation expansion of the electron density in fluctuation terms to various orders similar to the original density functional tight binding model. The term ``eXtended'' in their name (xTB) emphasizes the parameter availability for almost the entire periodic table of elements (Z {$\leq$} 86) and improvements of the underlying theory regarding, for example, the atomic orbital basis set, the level of multipole approximation and the treatment of the important electrostatic and dispersion interactions. A common feature of most members is their consistent parameterization on accurate gas phase theoretical reference data for geometries, vibrational frequencies and noncovalent interactions, which are the primary properties of interest in typical applications to systems composed of up to a few thousand atoms. Further specialized versions were developed for the description of electronic spectra and corresponding response properties. Besides a provided common theoretical background with some important implementation details in the efficient and free xtb program, various benchmarks for structural and thermochemical properties including (transition-)metal systems are discussed. The review is completed by recent extensions of the model to the force-field (FF) level as well as its application to solids under periodic boundary conditions. The general applicability together with the excellent cost-accuracy ratio and the high robustness make the xTB family of methods very attractive for various fields of computer-aided chemical research.

Particularly notable among these are the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE), which unified many of the earlier ideas around atom density-based descriptors, and Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), a message passing neural network with equivariant features that showed state of the art accuracy. In this work, we construct a mathematical framework that unifies these models: ACE is generalised so that it can be recast as one layer of a multi-layer architecture. From another point of view, the linearised version of NequIP is understood as a particular sparsification of a much larger polynomial model. Our framework also provides a practical tool for systematically probing different choices in the unified design space. We demonstrate this by an ablation study of NequIP via a set of experiments looking at in- and out-of-domain accuracy and smooth extrapolation very far from the training data, and shed some light on which design choices are critical for achieving high accuracy. Finally, we present BOTNet (Body-Ordered-Tensor-Network), a much-simplified version of NequIP, which has an interpretable architecture and maintains accuracy on benchmark datasets.},

The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets.

After the initial decade, in which neural networks were successfully used to construct potentials for rather small molecular systems, the development of high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs) in 2007 opened the way for the application of ML potentials in simulations of large systems containing thousands of atoms. To date, many other types of ML potentials have been proposed continuously increasing the range of problems that can be studied. In this review, the methodology of the family of HDNNPs including new recent developments will be discussed using a classification scheme into four generations of potentials, which is also applicable to many other types of ML potentials. The first generation is formed by early neural network potentials designed for low-dimensional systems. High-dimensional neural network potentials established the second generation and are based on three key steps: first, the expression of the total energy as a sum of environment-dependent atomic energy contributions; second, the description of the atomic environments by atom-centered symmetry functions as descriptors fulfilling the requirements of rotational, translational, and permutation invariance; and third, the iterative construction of the reference electronic structure data sets by active learning. In third-generation HDNNPs, in addition, long-range interactions are included employing environment-dependent partial charges expressed by atomic neural networks. In fourth-generation HDNNPs, which are just emerging, in addition, nonlocal phenomena such as long-range charge transfer can be included. The applicability and remaining limitations of HDNNPs are discussed along with an outlook at possible future developments.},

Because the uncatalyzed reaction is extremely slow, experimental studies bring limited and indirect information on the reaction mechanism, the nature of which remains debated. Here, we develop neural network potentials (NNPs) to study the phosphoester bond formation in water. While NNPs are becoming routinely applied to nonreactive systems or simple reactions, we demonstrate how they can systematically be trained to explore the reaction phase space for complex reactions involving several proton transfers and exchanges of heavy atoms. We then propagate at moderate computational cost hundreds of nanoseconds of a variety of enhanced sampling simulations with quantum accuracy in explicit solvent conditions. The thermodynamically preferred reaction pathway is a concerted, dissociative mechanism, with the transient formation of a metaphosphate transition state and direct participation of water solvent molecules that facilitate the exchange of protons through the nonbridging phosphate oxygens. Associative--dissociative pathways, characterized by a much tighter pentacoordinated phosphate, are higher in free energy. Our simulations also suggest that diprotonated phosphate, whose reactivity is never directly assessed in the experiments, is significantly less reactive than the monoprotonated species, suggesting that it is probably never the reactive species in normal pH conditions. These observations rationalize unexplained experimental results and the temperature dependence of the reaction rate, and they pave the way for the design of more efficient abiotic catalysts and activating groups.},

In this paper, we introduce stochastic cell rescaling, a first-order barostat that samples the correct volume fluctuations by including a suitable noise term. The algorithm is shown to report volume fluctuations compatible with the isobaric ensemble and its anisotropic variant is tested on a membrane simulation.

  abstract = {This book offers a comprehensive introduction to the central ideas that underpin deep learning. It is intended both for newcomers to machine learning and for those already experienced in the field. Covering key concepts relating to contemporary architectures and techniques, this essential book equips readers with a robust foundation for potential future specialization. The field of deep learning is undergoing rapid evolution, and therefore this book focusses on ideas that are likely to endure the test of time.The book is organized into numerous bite-sized chapters, each exploring a distinct topic, and the narrative follows a linear progression, with each chapter building upon content from its predecessors. This structure is well-suited to teaching a two-semester undergraduate or postgraduate machine learning course, while remaining equally relevant to those engaged in active research or in self-study.A full understanding of machine learning requires some mathematical background and so the book includes a self-contained introduction to probability theory. However, the focus of the book is on conveying a clear understanding of ideas, with emphasis on the real-world practical value of techniques rather than on abstract theory. Complex concepts are therefore presented from multiple complementary perspectives including textual descriptions, diagrams, mathematical formulae, and pseudo-code.Chris Bishop is a Technical Fellow at Microsoft and is the Director of Microsoft Research AI4Science.

  abstract = {Metadynamics is a widely used and successful method for reconstructing the free-energy surface of complex systems as a function of a small number of suitably chosen collective variables. This is achieved by biasing the dynamics of the system. The bias acting on the collective variables distorts the probability distribution of the other variables. Here we present a simple reweighting algorithm for recovering the unbiased probability distribution of any variable from a well-tempered metadynamics simulation. We show the efficiency of the reweighting procedure by reconstructing the distribution of the four backbone dihedral angles of alanine dipeptide from two and even one dimensional metadynamics simulation. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

ATP is universally seen as the energy exchange factor that connects anabolism and catabolism but also fuels processes such as motile contraction, phosphorylations, and active transport. It is also a signalling molecule in the purinergic signalling mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss all the main mechanisms of ATP production linked to ADP phosphorylation as well the regulation of these mechanisms during stress conditions and in connection with calcium signalling events.

Secondly, we present a recommendation matrix to guide the choice of functional and basis set depending on the task at hand. A particular focus is on achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency through multi-level approaches.

In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling.

It is based on iteratively `filling' the potential energy of the system by a sum of Gaussians centred along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables (CVs), thereby forcing the system to migrate from one minimum to the next. The power of metadynamics is demonstrated by the large number of extensions and variants that have been developed. The first scope of this Technical Review is to present a critical comparison of these variants, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. The effectiveness of metadynamics, and that of the numerous alternative methods, is strongly influenced by the choice of the CVs. If an important variable is neglected, the resulting estimate of the free energy is unreliable, and predicted transition mechanisms may be qualitatively wrong. The second scope of this Technical Review is to discuss how the CVs should be selected, how to verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using machine learning approaches.},

Attempts to place Grotthuss contribution in the context of the science done at his time were also made. In Section 2, the modern version of the Grotthuss mechanism is reviewed. The classical Grotthuss model has been recently questioned and new mechanisms and ideas regarding proton transfer are briefly discussed. The last section discusses the significance of a classical Grotthuss mechanism for proton transfer in water chains inside protein cavities. This has been an interesting new twist in the ongoing history of the Grotthuss mechanism. A summary and discussion of what was learned from probably the simplest currently available experimental models of proton transfer in water wires in semi-synthetic ion channels are critically presented. This review ends discussing some of the questions that need to be addressed in the near future.},

  abstract = {The general theory of quantum mechanics is now almost complete, the imperfections that still remain being in connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas. These give rise to difficulties only when high-speed particles are involved, and are therefore of no importance in the consideration of atomic and molecular structure and ordinary chemical reactions, in which it is, indeed, usually sufficiently accurate if one neglects relativity variation of mass with velocity and assumes only Coulomb forces between the various electrons and atomic nuclei. The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It there fore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation. Already before the arrival of quantum mechanics there existed a theory of atomic structure, based on Bohr's ideas of quantised orbits, which was fairly successful in a wide field. To get agreement with experiment it was found necessary to introduce the spin of the electron, giving a doubling in the number of orbits of an electron in an atom. With the help of this spin and Pauli's exclusion principle, a satisfactory theory of multiplet terms was obtained when one made the additional assumption that the electrons in an atom all set themselves with their spins parallel or antiparallel. If s denoted the magnitude of the resultant spin angular momentum, this s was combined vectorially with the resultant orbital angular momentum l to give a multiplet of multiplicity 2s + 1. The fact that one had to make this additional assumption was, however, a serious disadvantage, as no theoretical reasons to support it could be given. It seemed to show that there were large forces coupling the spin vectors of the electrons in an atom, much larger forces than could be accounted for as due to the interaction of the magnetic moments of the electrons. The position was thus that there was empirical evidence in favour of these large forces, but that their theoretical nature was quite unknown.},

  abstract = {Understanding phosphoryl and sulfuryl transfer is central to many biochemical processes. However, despite decades of experimental and computational studies, a consensus concerning the precise mechanistic details of these reactions has yet to be reached. In this work we perform a detailed comparative theoretical study of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, methyl phosphate and p-nitrophenyl sulfate, all of which have served as key model systems for understanding phosphoryl and sulfuryl transfer reactions, respectively. We demonstrate the existence of energetically similar but mechanistically distinct possibilities for phosphate monoester hydrolysis. The calculated kinetic isotope effects for p-nitrophenyl phosphate provide a means to discriminate between substrate- and solvent-assisted pathways of phosphate monoester hydrolysis, and show that the solvent-assisted pathway dominates in solution. This preferred mechanism for p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis is difficult to find computationally due to the limitations of compressing multiple bonding changes onto a 2-dimensional energy surface. This problem is compounded by the need to include implicit solvation to at least microsolvate the system and stabilize the highly charged species. In contrast, methyl phosphate hydrolysis shows a preference for a substrate-assisted mechanism. For p-nitrophenyl sulfate hydrolysis there is only one viable reaction pathway, which is similar to the solvent-assisted pathway for phosphate hydrolysis, and the substrate-assisted pathway is not accessible. Overall, our results provide a unifying mechanistic framework that is consistent with the experimentally measured kinetic isotope effects and reconciles the discrepancies between theoretical and experimental models for these biochemically ubiquitous classes of reaction.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation techniques are widely used for various natural science applications. Increasingly, machine learning (ML) force field (FF) models begin to replace ab-initio simulations by predicting forces directly from atomic structures. Despite significant progress in this area, such techniques are primarily benchmarked by their force/energy prediction errors, even though the practical use case would be to produce realistic MD trajectories. We aim to fill this gap by introducing a novel benchmark suite for learned MD simulation. We curate representative MD systems, including water, organic molecules, a peptide, and materials, and design evaluation metrics corresponding to the scientific objectives of respective systems. We benchmark a collection of state-of-the-art (SOTA) ML FF models and illustrate, in particular, how the commonly benchmarked force accuracy is not well aligned with relevant simulation metrics. We demonstrate when and how selected SOTA methods fail, along with offering directions for further improvement. Specifically, we identify stability as a key metric for ML models to improve. Our benchmark suite comes with a comprehensive open-source codebase for training and simulation with ML FFs to facilitate future work.},

  abstract = {Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) has become established as an indispensable tool for investigating aqueous systems of all kinds, including those important in chemistry, surface science, biology, and the earth sciences. Nevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures, and liquid water, with the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC approximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate balance between compact and extended structures of many different water systems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work, we argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted, and we also discuss the substantial differences between different representations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system that rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water systems, and we suggest possible future developments.},

The timescale of the reaction was accessed through use of an accelerated sampling method, metadynamics. Both hydrolyses were found to proceed via different mechanisms; the acidic system reacted by means of concerted general acid catalysis (found to be a so-called DNANAHDxh mechanism), whereas the neutral system reacted by way of a different mechanism (namely, DN*ANDxhAH). A neighboring water molecule took on the role of a general base in both systems, which has not been seen before but is a highly plausible reaction path, meaning that substrate-assisted catalysis was not observed in the bulk water environment.},

The pseudopotential is of an analytic form that gives optimal efficiency in numerical calculations using plane waves as a basis set.

Because of this property, the application of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect to the size of the system.

  abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn--Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15\%--40\% compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10\%) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems.},

  abstract = {It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard ``zero-damping'' formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The accuracy of the method, called Geometry, Frequency, Noncovalent, eXtended TB (GFN-xTB), is extensively benchmarked for various systems in comparison with existing semiempirical approaches, and the method is applied to a few representative structural problems in chemistry.},

  abstract = {Hydrolysis of phosphate groups is a crucial reaction in living cells. It involves the breaking of two strong bonds, i.e. the OaH bond of the attacking water molecule, and the POl bond of the substrate (Oa and Ol stand for attacking and leaving oxygen atoms). Mechanism of the hydrolysis reaction can proceed either by a concurrent or a sequential mechanism. In the concurrent mechanism, the breaking of OaH and POl bonds occurs simultaneously, whereas in the sequential mechanism, the OaH and POl bonds break at different stages of the reaction. To understand how protonation affects the mechanism of hydrolysis of phosphate monoester, we have studied the mechanism of hydrolysis of protonated and deprotonated phosphate monoester at M06-2X/6-311+G**//M06-2X/6-31+G*+ZPE level of theory (where ZPE stands for zero point energy). Our calculations show that in both protonated and deprotonated cases, the breaking of the water OaH bond occurs before the breaking of the POl bond. Because the two events are not separated by a stable intermediate, the mechanism can be categorized as semi-concurrent. The overall energy barrier is 41kcalmol-1 in the unprotonated case. Most (5/6th) of this is due to the initial breaking of the water OaH bond. This component is lowered from 34 to 25kcalmol-1 by adding one proton to the phosphate. The rest of the overall energy barrier comes from the subsequent breaking of the POl bond and is not sensitive to protonation. This is consistent with previous findings about the effect of triphosphate protonation on the hydrolysis, where the equivalent protonation (on the {$\gamma$}-phosphate) was seen to lower the barrier of breaking the water OaH bond and to have little effect on the POl bond breaking. Hydrolysis pathways of phosphate monoester with initial breaking of the POl bond could not be found here. This is because the leaving group in phosphate monoester cannot be protonated, unlike in triphosphate hydrolysis, where protonation of the {$\beta$}- and {$\gamma$}-phosphates had been shown to promote a mechanism where the POl bond breaks before the OaH bond does. We also point out that the charge shift due to POl bond breaking during sequential ATP hydrolysis in bio-molecular motors onsets the week unbinding of hydrolysis product that finally leads to the product release during power stroke.},

The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta {$ps$} and {$pv$}. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, {$px$}, V, {\.undefined}, and {$\zeta$}, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables {\.undefined} and {$\zeta$} act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated.

  abstract = {VMD is a molecular graphics program designed for the display and analysis of molecular assemblies, in particular biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids. VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more ``representations,'' in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

  abstract = {Phosphate monoester and anhydride hydrolysis is ubiquitous in biology, being involved in, amongst other things, signal transduction, energy production, and the regulation of protein function. Therefore, this reaction has understandably been the focus of intensive research. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism by which phosphate monoester hydrolysis proceeds remains controversial. Traditionally, it has been assumed and frequently implied that a near-zero activation entropy is indicative of a dissociative pathway. Herein, we examine free-energy surfaces for the hydrolysis of the methyl phosphate dianion and the methyl pyrophosphate trianion in aqueous solution. In both cases, the reaction can proceed through either compact or expansive concerted (ANDN) transition states, with fairly similar barriers. We have evaluated the activation entropies for each transition state and demonstrate that both associative and dissociative transition states have near-zero entropies of activation that are in good agreement with experimental values. Therefore, we believe that the activation entropy alone is not a useful diagnostic tool, as it depends not only on bond orders at the transition state, but also on other issues that include (but are not limited to) steric factors determining the configurational volumes available to reactants during the reaction, solvation and desolvation effects that may be associated with charge redistribution upon approaching the transition state and entropy changes associated with intramolecular degrees of freedom as the transition state is approached.},

  abstract = {Phosphoryl transfer plays key roles in signaling, energy transduction, protein synthesis, and maintaining the integrity of the genetic material. On the surface, it would appear to be a simple nucleophile displacement reaction. However, this simplicity is deceptive, as, even in aqueous solution, the low-lying d-orbitals on the phosphorus atom allow for eight distinct mechanistic possibilities, before even introducing the complexities of the enzyme catalyzed reactions. To further complicate matters, while powerful, traditional experimental techniques such as the use of linear free-energy relationships (LFER) or measuring isotope effects cannot make unique distinctions between different potential mechanisms. A quarter of a century has passed since Westheimer wrote his seminal review, `Why Nature Chose Phosphate' (Science 235 (1987), 1173), and a lot has changed in the field since then. The present review revisits this biologically crucial issue, exploring both relevant enzymatic systems as well as the corresponding chemistry in aqueous solution, and demonstrating that the only way key questions in this field are likely to be resolved is through careful theoretical studies (which of course should be able to reproduce all relevant experimental data). Finally, we demonstrate that the reason that nature really chose phosphate is due to interplay between two counteracting effects: on the one hand, phosphates are negatively charged and the resulting charge-charge repulsion with the attacking nucleophile contributes to the very high barrier for hydrolysis, making phosphate esters among the most inert compounds known. However, biology is not only about reducing the barrier to unfavorable chemical reactions. That is, the same charge-charge repulsion that makes phosphate ester hydrolysis so unfavorable also makes it possible to regulate, by exploiting the electrostatics. This means that phosphate ester hydrolysis can not only be turned on, but also be turned off, by fine tuning the electrostatic environment and the present review demonstrates numerous examples where this is the case. Without this capacity for regulation, it would be impossible to have for instance a signaling or metabolic cascade, where the action of each participant is determined by the fine-tuned activity of the previous piece in the production line. This makes phosphate esters the ideal compounds to facilitate life as we know it.},

Here, we describe Multicomponent Assembler in CHARMM-GUI that automates complex molecular assembly and simulation input preparation under the PBC. In this work, we demonstrate its versatility by preparing 6 challenging systems with varying density of large components: (1) solvated proteins, (2) solvated proteins with a pre-equilibrated membrane, (3) solvated proteins with a sheet-like nanomaterial, (4) solvated proteins with a sheet-like polymer, (5) a mixed membrane-nanomaterial system, and (6) a sheet-like polymer with gaseous solvent.

  abstract = {ConspectusHistorically, the chemistry of phosphate transfer---a class of reactions fundamental to the chemistry of Life---has been discussed almost exclusively in terms of the nucleophile and the leaving group. Reactivity always depends significantly on both factors; but recent results for reactions of phosphate triesters have shown that it can also depend strongly on the nature of the nonleaving or ``spectator'' groups. The extreme stabilities of fully ionised mono- and dialkyl phosphate esters can be seen as extensions of the same effect, with one or two triester OR groups replaced by O--. Our chosen lead reaction is hydrolysis--phosphate transfer to water: because water is the medium in which biological chemistry takes place; because the half-life of a system in water is an accepted basic index of stability; and because the typical mechanisms of hydrolysis, with solvent H2O providing specific molecules to act as nucleophiles and as general acids or bases, are models for reactions involving better nucleophiles and stronger general species catalysts. Not least those available in enzyme active sites.Alkyl monoester dianions compete with alkyl diester monoanions for the slowest estimated rates of spontaneous hydrolysis. High stability at physiological pH is a vital factor in the biological roles of organic phosphates, but a significant limitation for experimental investigations. Almost all kinetic measurements of phosphate transfer reactions involving mono- and diesters have been followed by UV--visible spectroscopy using activated systems, conveniently compounds with good leaving groups. (A ``good leaving group'' OR* is electron-withdrawing, and can be displaced to generate an anion R*O-- in water near pH 7.) Reactivities at normal temperatures of P--O-alkyl derivatives---better models for typical biological substrates---have typically had to be estimated: by extended extrapolation from linear free energy relationships, or from rate measurements at high temperatures.Calculation is free from these limitations, able to handle very slow reactions as readily as very fast ones, and capable of predicting rate constants with levels of accuracy acceptable to the experimentalist. We present an updated overview of phosphate transfer, with particular reference to the mechanisms of the reactions of alkyl derivatives and triesters. The intention is to present a holistic (not comprehensive!) overview of the reactivity of typical phosphate esters, in terms familiar to the working chemist, at a level sufficient to support informed predictions of reactivity for structures of interest.},

  abstract = {The nature of the hydrolysis of phosphate monoester dianions in solutions and in proteins is a problem of significant current interest. The present work explores this problem by systematic calculations of the potential surfaces of the reactions of a series of phosphate monoesters with different leaving groups. These calculations involve computational studies ranging from ab initio calculations with implicit solvent models to ab initio QM/MM free energy calculations. The calculations reproduce the observed linear free energy relationship (LFER) for the solution reaction and thus are consistent with the overall experimental trend and can be used to explore the nature of the transition state (TS) region, which is not accessible to direct experimental studies. It is found that the potential surface for the associative and dissociative paths is very flat and that the relative height of the associative and dissociative TS is different in different systems. In general, the character of the TS changes from associative to dissociative upon decrease in the pKa of the leaving group. It is also demonstrated that traditional experimental markers such as isotope effects and the LFER slope cannot be used in a conclusive way to distinguish between the two classes of transition states. In addition it is found that the effective charges of the TS do not follow the previously assumed simple rule. Armed with that experience we explore the free energy surface for the GTPase reaction of the RasGap system. In this case it is found that the surface is flat but that the lowest TS is associative. The present study indicates that the nature of the potential surfaces for the phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution and proteins is quite complicated and cannot be determined in a conclusive way without the use of careful theoretical studies that should, of course, reproduce the available experimental information.},

The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm.},

The solvation effects were taken into account with explicit water. Detailed free energy landscapes in two-dimensional and three-dimensional space were resolved using the multidimensional potential of mean constraint force, a newly developed method that was demonstrated to be powerful for free energy calculations along multiple coordinates. As in previous theoretical studies, the associative and dissociative pathways were indistinguishable. Furthermore, the associative pathway was investigated in great detail. We propose a rotation of an O--H bond in the transition between two pentacoordinated structures, during which an overall transition state was identified with an activation energy of 50 kcal/mol. This is consistent with experimental data. The results support a concerted proton transfer from the nucleophilic water to the phosphate group, and then to the leaving group.},

However, extracting the relevant data of complex 3D energy surfaces can sometimes be laborious. In this article, we present MEPSA (Minimum Energy Path Surface Analysis), a cross-platform user friendly tool for the analysis of energy landscapes from a transition state theory perspective. Some of its most relevant features are: identification of all the barriers and minima of the landscape at once, description of maxima edge profiles, detection of the lowest energy path connecting two minima and generation of transition state theory diagrams along these paths. In addition to a built-in plotting system, MEPSA can save most of the generated data into easily parseable text files, allowing more versatile uses of MEPSA's output such as the generation of molecular dynamics restraints from a calculated path.Availability and implementation: MEPSA is freely available (under GPLv3 license) at: http://bioweb.cbm.uam.es/software/MEPSA/Contact: pagomez@cbm.csic.esSupplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Those simulations replicate the experimental value of the self-diffusion constant as a function of temperature by tuning the damping factor of the Langevin equation of motion. A stretched exponential function exp[-(t/{$\tau$}){$\beta$}] has been found to properly describe the relaxation of residence times calculated at different temperatures for solvent molecules in a nanodrop of free water modelled as a sphere of nanometric dimensions. As the temperature goes down the decay time {$\tau$} increases showing a divergence at Ts = 227 {\textpm} 3 K. The temperature independence of the dimensionless stretched exponent {$\beta$} = 0.59 {\textpm} 0.01 suggests the presence of, not a characteristic relaxation time (since {$\beta$} {$\neq$} 1), but a distribution of decay times that also holds at low temperature. An explanation for such heterogeneity can be found at the nanoscopic level. Moreover it can be concluded that the distribution of times already reported for the dynamics of water surrounding proteins ({$\beta$} {$\leq$} 0.5) can not be exclusively due to the presence of the biomolecule itself since isolated water also exhibits such behaviour. The above reported Ts and {$\beta$} values quantitatively reproduce experimental data.},

They are evolutionarily old biopolymers that are present from bacteria to man. No other molecule concentrates as much (bio)chemically usable energy as polyP. However, the function and metabolism of this long-neglected polymer are scarcely known, especially in higher eukaryotes. In recent years, interest in polyP experienced a renaissance, beginning with the discovery of polyP as phosphate source in bone mineralization. Later, two discoveries placed polyP into the focus of regenerative medicine applications. First, polyP shows morphogenetic activity, i.e., induces cell differentiation via gene induction, and, second, acts as an energy storage and donor in the extracellular space. Studies on acidocalcisomes and mitochondria provided first insights into the enzymatic basis of eukaryotic polyP formation. In addition, a concerted action of alkaline phosphatase and adenylate kinase proved crucial for ADP/ATP generation from polyP. PolyP added extracellularly to mammalian cells resulted in a 3-fold increase of ATP. The importance and mechanism of this phosphotransfer reaction for energy-consuming processes in the extracellular matrix are discussed. This review aims to give a critical overview about the formation and function of this unique polymer that is capable of storing (bio)chemically useful energy.},

Local methods, conversely, scale to large simulations but have suffered from inferior accuracy. This work introduces Allegro, a strictly local equivariant deep neural network interatomic potential architecture that simultaneously exhibits excellent accuracy and scalability. Allegro represents a many-body potential using iterated tensor products of learned equivariant representations without atom-centered message passing. Allegro obtains improvements over state-of-the-art methods on QM9 and revMD17. A single tensor product layer outperforms existing deep MPNNs and transformers on QM9. Furthermore, Allegro displays remarkable generalization to out-of-distribution data. Molecular simulations using Allegro recover structural and kinetic properties of an amorphous electrolyte in excellent agreement with ab-initio simulations. Finally, we demonstrate parallelization with a simulation of 100 million atoms.},

There is very limited information regarding the ability of polyP to transmit the information as an agonist of purinoreceptors in other cells and tissues. Here, we show that application of polyP to the suspension of primary thymocytes increases the concentration of intracellular calcium. PolyP evoked calcium signal was dependent on the presence of P2X inhibitors but not P2Y1 inhibitor. PolyP dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentration caused mild mitochondrial depolarization, which was dependent on inhibitors of purinoreceptors, extracellular calcium and inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uniporter but wasn't dependent on cyclosporin A. Application of polyP modulated cell volume regulation machinery of thymocytes in calcium dependent manner. Molecular docking experiments revealed that polyP can potentially bind to several types of P2X receptors with binding energy similar to ATP - natural agonist of P2X purinoreceptors. Further molecular dynamics simulations with P2X4 showed that binding of one molecule of polyP dramatically increases permeability of this receptor-channel for water molecules. Thus, in this research we for the first time showed that polyP can interact with P2X receptors in thymocytes and modulate physiological processes.},

We have examined the mechanism of poly P production and the role of this polymer in cell energy metabolism. Poly P levels in mitochondria and intact cells were estimated using a fluorescent molecular probe, 4{$\prime$},6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Poly P levels were dependent on the metabolic state of the mitochondria. Poly P levels were increased by substrates of respiration and in turn reduced by mitochondrial inhibitor (rotenone) or an uncoupler (carbonyl cyanide \emph{p}-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone). Oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP-synthase, blocked the production of poly P. Enzymatic depletion of poly P from cells significantly altered the rate of ATP metabolism.

In this context, important advances have been made in recent years, including the development of sophisticated exchange-correlation functionals. On the other hand, simulations based on simple generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functionals remain an active field, particularly in the study of complex aqueous solutions due to a good balance between the accuracy, computational expense, and the applicability to a wide range of systems. Such simulations are often performed at elevated temperatures to artificially ``correct'' for GGA inaccuracies in the description of liquid water; however, a detailed understanding of how the choice of temperature affects the structure and dynamics of other components, such as solvated ions, is largely unknown. To address this question, we carried out a series of FPMD simulations at temperatures ranging from 300 to 460 K for liquid water and three representative aqueous solutions containing solvated Na+, K+, and Cl- ions. We show that simulations at 390--400 K with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional yield water structure and dynamics in good agreement with experiments at ambient conditions. Simultaneously, this computational setup provides ion solvation structures and ion effects on water dynamics consistent with experiments. Our results suggest that an elevated temperature around 390--400 K with the PBE functional can be used for the description of structural and dynamical properties of liquid water and complex solutions with solvated ions at ambient conditions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the nature of the free-energy surfaces for phosphate hydrolysis is a prerequisite for understanding the corresponding key chemical reactions in biology. Here, the challenge has been to move to careful ab initio QM/MM (QM(ai)/MM) free-energy calculations, where obtaining converging results is very demanding and computationally expensive. This work describes such calculations, focusing on the free-energy surface for the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters, paying special attention to the comparison between the one water (1W) and two water (2W) paths for the proton-transfer (PT) step. This issue has been explored before by energy minimization with implicit solvent models and by nonsystematic QM/MM energy minimization, as well as by nonsystematic free-energy mapping. However, no study has provided the needed reliable 2D (3D) surfaces that are necessary for reaching concrete conclusions. Here we report a systematic evaluation of the 2D (3D) free-energy maps for several relevant systems, comparing the results of QM(ai)/MM and QM(ai)/implicit solvent surfaces, and provide an advanced description of the relevant energetics. It is found that the 1W path for the hydrolysis of the methyl diphosphate (MDP) trianion is 6--9 kcal/mol higher than that the 2W path. This difference becomes slightly larger in the presence of the Mg2+ ion because this ion reduces the pKa of the conjugated acid form of the phosphate oxygen that accepts the proton. Interestingly, the BLYP approach (which has been used extensively in some studies) gives a much smaller difference between the 1W and 2W activation barriers. At any rate, it is worth pointing out that the 2W transition state for the PT is not much higher that the common plateau that serves as the starting point of both the 1W and 2W PT paths. Thus, the calculated catalytic effects of proteins based on the 2W PT mechanistic model are not expected to be different from the catalytic effects predicted using the 1W PT mechanistic model, which was calibrated on the observed barrier in solution and in which the TS charge distribution was similar to the that of the plateau (as was done in all of our previous EVB studies).},

  abstract = {The nature and mechanism of phosphate hydrolysis reactions are of great interest in view of the crucial role of these reactions in key biological processes. Although it is becoming clearer that the ultimate way of resolving mechanistic controversies must involve reliable theoretical studies, it is not widely realized that such studies cannot be performed at present by using most existing automated ways and that only careful systematic studies can lead to meaningful conclusions. The present work clarifies the above point by considering the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters. The clarification starts by defining the actual issues that should be addressed in careful studies and by highlighting the problems with studies that ignore the need for unique mechanistic definitions (e.g., works that confuse associative and dissociative pathways). We then focus on the analysis of the proton transfer (PT) pathways in phosphate hydrolysis and on recent suggestions that PT involves more than one water molecule. Here we point out that most of the studies that found a proton transfer through several water molecules have not involved a sufficient systematic search of the relevant reaction coordinates. This includes both energy minimization approaches as well as a recent metadynamics (MTD) simulation study. To illustrate the crucial need of exploring the potential surfaces reliably, rather than relying on automated approaches, we present here a very careful study of the free energy landscape along a 3D reaction coordinate (RC) exploring both the standard 2D RC, comprised of the attacking and leaving group reaction coordinates, as well as of the proton transfer (PT) coordinate. Our study points out that QM/MM minimization or MTD studies that concluded that the hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters involves a PT through several water molecules, have not explored carefully the single water (1W) path (that involves a direct PT form the attacking water molecule to the phosphate oxygen). Furthermore, we identified the most likely reason for the difficulty in finding the 1W path by QM/MM minimization methods, as well as by the current MTD simulations. We also discuss the problems with current studies that challenge the phosphate as a base mechanism and emphasize that all recent studies found associative/concerted paths (although many have not realized the meaning of their results). Finally, although we clearly do not have the last word about the 1W versus 2W paths we believe that we illustrated that the crucial mechanistic problems with alternative pathways should not be resolved by just running black box search approaches.},

The effect of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions on the rate of hydrolysis is similar to the effect of these cations on the rate of hydrolysis of ATP.

  abstract = {Since the classical molecular dynamics simulator LAMMPS was released as an open source code in 2004, it has become a widely-used tool for particle-based modeling of materials at length scales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to continuum. Reasons for its popularity are that it provides a wide variety of particle interaction models for different materials, that it runs on any platform from a single CPU core to the largest supercomputers with accelerators, and that it gives users control over simulation details, either via the input script or by adding code for new interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, or other features needed for their models. As a result, hundreds of people have contributed new capabilities to LAMMPS and it has grown from fifty thousand lines of code in 2004 to a million lines today. In this paper several of the fundamental algorithms used in LAMMPS are described along with the design strategies which have made it flexible for both users and developers. We also highlight some capabilities recently added to the code which were enabled by this flexibility, including dynamic load balancing, on-the-fly visualization, magnetic spin dynamics models, and quantum-accuracy machine learning interatomic potentials.

Within this common problem definition, there lies a great diversity of use cases, distinguished by different particle interaction models, external constraints, as well as timescales and lengthscales ranging from atomic to mesoscale to macroscopic. Solution method: The LAMMPS code uses parallel spatial decomposition, distributed neighbor lists, and parallel FFTs for long-range Coulombic interactions [1]. The time integration algorithm is based on the St{\o}rmer-Verlet symplectic integrator [2], which provides better stability than higher-order non-symplectic methods. In addition, LAMMPS supports a wide range of interatomic potentials, constraints, diagnostics, software interfaces, and pre- and post-processing features. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This paper serves as the definitive reference for the LAMMPS code. References [1]S.

  abstract = {Enhancing sampling and analyzing simulations are central issues in molecular simulation. Recently, we introduced PLUMED, an open-source plug-in that provides some of the most popular molecular dynamics (MD) codes with implementations of a variety of different enhanced sampling algorithms and collective variables (CVs). The rapid changes in this field, in particular new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient. We therefore present PLUMED 2 here---a complete rewrite of the code in an object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping with the new challenges arising in the field.

Computer: Any computer capable of running an executable produced by a C++~compiler. Operating system: Linux operating system, Unix OSs. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes, parallelized using MPI. RAM: Depends on the number of atoms, the method chosen and the collective variables used. Classification: 3, 7.7, 23. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEEE\_v1\_0. Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 1961. External routines: GNU libmatheval, Lapack, Blas, MPI. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: This version supersedes the previous version for the most part. There are a small number of very specific situations where the previous version is better, due to performance or to non-ported features. We are actively working on porting these last few features into the new code. Nature of problem: Calculation of free-energy surfaces for molecular systems of interest in biology, chemistry and materials science, on the fly and a posteriori analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories using advanced collective variables. Solution method: Implementations of various collective variables and enhanced sampling techniques. Reasons for new version: The old version was difficult to maintain and its design was not as flexible as this new version. This lack of flexibility made it difficult to implement a number of novel methods that have emerged since the release of the original code. Summary of revisions: The new version of the code has a completely redesigned architecture, which allows for several important enhancements. This allows for a much simpler and robust input syntax and for improved performance. In addition, it provides several, more-complex collective variables which could not have been written using the previous implementation. Furthermore, the entire code is fully documented so it is easier to extend. Finally, the code is designed so that users can implement new variables directly in the input files and thus develop bespoke applications of these powerful algorithms. Unusual features: PLUMED 2 can be used either as a standalone program, e.g. for a posteriori analysis of trajectories, or as a library embedded in a molecular dynamics code (such as GROMACS, NAMD, Quantum ESPRESSO, and LAMMPS). Interfaces with these particular codes are provided in patches, which a simple script will insert into the underlying molecular dynamics codes source code files. For other molecular dynamics codes there is extensive documentation on how to add PLUMED in our manual. Additional comments: The distribution file contains a test suite, user and developer documentation and a collection of patches and utilities. Running time: Depends on the number of atoms, the method chosen and the collective variables used. The regression test suite provided takes approximately 1 min to run.},

The GPW method allows for accurate density functional calculations in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional, namely ionic forces and the Kohn--Sham matrix, can be computed in a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy and the Kohn--Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size, even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases. Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent. Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation methods. Energy conserving Born--Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed, and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations using commodity PCs as well as supercomputers.},

For example, ATP synthases from bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts differ in the mechanisms of regulation of their activity, and the molecular bases of these different mechanisms and their physiological roles are only just beginning to emerge. Another crucial feature lacking a molecular description is how rotation driven by {$\Delta$}p is generated, and how rotation transmits energy into the catalytic sites of the enzyme to produce the stepping action during rotation. One surprising and incompletely explained deduction based on the symmetries of c-rings in the rotor of the enzyme is that the amount of energy required by the ATP synthase to make an ATP molecule does not have a universal value. ATP synthases from multicellular organisms require the least energy, whereas the energy required to make an ATP molecule in unicellular organisms and chloroplasts is higher, and a range of values has been calculated. Finally, evidence is growing for other roles of ATP synthases in the inner membranes of mitochondria. Here the enzymes form supermolecular complexes, possibly with specific lipids, and these complexes probably contribute to, or even determine, the formation of the cristae.},

In the crystal structure of the catalytic F1 domain of this enzyme there is indeed a complex made up of three {$\alpha$} subunits and three {$\beta$} subunits arranged in alternation around a central {$\alpha$}-helical segment of the {$\gamma$} subunit. This complex is asymmetric owing to the different conformations of the {$\beta$} subunits.

  abstract = {Adenosine-5{$\prime$}-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis represents a most important reaction in biology. Despite extensive research efforts, the mechanism for ATP hydrolysis in aqueous solution still remains under debate. Previous theoretical studies often predefined reaction coordinates to characterize the mechanism for ATP hydrolysis in water with Mg2+ by evaluating free energy profiles through these preassumed reaction paths. In the present work, a nudged elastic band method is applied to identify the minimum energy path calculated with a hybrid quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics approach. Along the reaction path, the free energy profile was obtained to have a single transition state and the activation energy of 32.5 kcal/mol. This transition state bears a four-centered structure that describes a concerted nature of the reaction. In the More--O'Ferrall--Jencks diagram, the results show that the reaction proceeds through a concerted path before the system reaches the transition state and along an associative path after the transition state. In addition, the calculated reaction free energy is -7.0 kcal/mol, in good agreement with experiment, capturing the exothermic feature of MgATP2-- hydrolysis in aqueous solution, whereas the reaction was often shown to be endothermic in the previous theoretical studies. As Mg2+ is required for ATP hydrolysis in cells, its role in the reaction is also elucidated.},

  abstract = {The catalytic domain of the F-ATPase in mitochondria protrudes into the matrix of the organelle, and is attached to the membrane domain by central and peripheral stalks. Energy for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and phosphate is provided by the transmembrane proton-motive-force across the inner membrane, generated by respiration. The proton-motive force is coupled mechanically to ATP synthesis by the rotation at about 100 times per second of the central stalk and an attached ring of c-subunits in the membrane domain. Each c-subunit carries a glutamate exposed around the midpoint of the membrane on the external surface of the ring. The rotation is generated by protonation and deprotonation successively of each glutamate. Each 360{$^\circ$} rotation produces three ATP molecules, and requires the translocation of one proton per glutamate by each c-subunit in the ring. In fungi, eubacteria, and plant chloroplasts, ring sizes of c10--c15 subunits have been observed, implying that these enzymes need 3.3--5 protons to make each ATP, but until now no higher eukaryote has been examined. As shown here in the structure of the bovine F1-c-ring complex, the c-ring has eight c-subunits. As the sequences of c-subunits are identical throughout almost all vertebrates and are highly conserved in invertebrates, their F-ATPases probably contain c8-rings also. Therefore, in about 50,000 vertebrate species, and probably in many or all of the two million invertebrate species, 2.7 protons are required by the F-ATPase to make each ATP molecule.},

  abstract = {Phosphate esters and anhydrides dominate the living world but are seldom used as intermediates by organic chemists. Phosphoric acid is specially adapted for its role in nucleic acids because it can link two nucleotides and still ionize; the resulting negative charge serves both to stabilize the diesters against hydrolysis and to retain the molecules within a lipid membrane. A similar explanation for stability and retention also holds for phosphates that are intermediary metabolites and for phosphates that serve as energy sources. Phosphates with multiple negative charges can react by way of the monomeric metaphosphate ion PO3- as an intermediate. No other residue appears to fulfill the multiple roles of phosphate in biochemistry. Stable, negatively charged phosphates react under catalysis by enzymes; organic chemists, who can only rarely use enzymatic catalysis for their reactions, need more highly reactive intermediates than phosphates.},

  abstract = {The study of chemical reactions in aqueous media is very important for its implications in several fields of science, from biology to industrial processes. However, modeling these reactions is difficult when water directly participates in the reaction, since it requires a fully quantum mechanical description of the system. Ab-initio molecular dynamics is the ideal candidate to shed light on these processes. However, its scope is limited by a high computational cost. A popular alternative is to perform molecular dynamics simulations powered by machine learning potentials, trained on an extensive set of quantum mechanical calculations. Doing so reliably for reactive processes is difficult because it requires including very many intermediate and transition state configurations. In this study we used an active learning procedure accelerated by enhanced sampling to harvest such structures and to build a neural-network potential to study the urea decomposition process in water. This allowed us to obtain the free energy profiles of this important reaction in a wide range of temperatures, to discover several novel metastable states, and improve the accuracy of the kinetic rates calculations. Furthermore, we found that the formation of the zwitterionic intermediate has the same probability of occurring via an acidic or a basic pathway, which could be the cause of the insensitivity of reaction rates to the solution pH.},

The latter proceeds involving a contact anionic-glycine--hydronium ion pair or separate cationic-glycine--hydroxide ion pair. These pathways with comparable barriers contribute almost equally to the reaction flux.},

In this work, we present an ab initio atomistic simulation-based study to explore the structure of water and hydrated monovalent ions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, F--, and Cl--) at ambient conditions using generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-based methods with and without van der Waals correction (PBE, PBE + D3, and revPBE + D3) and recently developed strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA. We find that both revPBE + D3 and SCAN can well capture the structure of bulk water with +30 K artificial high temperature in contrast to overstructuring water using PBE and PBE + D3. However, being the same as PBE + D3, revPBE + D3 overestimates the structure of the hydration shell, especially for monovalent cations. Surprisingly, SCAN can well match the experimental results of hydrated monovalent ions. Detailed structure analyzes of entropy reveal that the hydration shell under the level of PBE + D3 and revPBE + D3 is more disordered and looser than SCAN. The successful prediction of the flexible SCAN functional could facilitate the exploration of complex ionic processes in the aqueous phase, the interactions of hydrated ions with surfaces, and solvation states in nanopores at an accurate, efficient, predictive, and ab initio level.},
